<p><i>A great ledge in Ogden Canyon near Ogden, Utah. The
rock, still retaining its stratification, was deposited layer
upon layer horizontally mostly as sand upon the floor of a sea
which covered the region fully 25,000,000 years ago. That the
sea was of very early Paleozoic (i.e., Cambrian) age has been
proved by fossils in associated strata. Long after their deep
burial and consolidation within the earth, the strata were subjected
to tremendous mountain-making pressure, notably
altered to a rock called &ldquo;Quartzite,&rdquo; raised high above sea
level, and tilted almost vertically. Then through long ages
(millions of years) overlying rocks of great thickness have
been cut away (eroded) by weathering and stream action,
laying bare the ledge as we see it to-day.</i></p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">I</span>n the preparation of this book the author has
attempted to present, in popular form, the salient
points of a general survey of the whole great science
of geology, the science which deals with the history of
the earth and its inhabitants as revealed in the rocks.</p>

<p>The use of technical and unusual terms has been
reduced to a minimum compatible with a reasonable
understanding of the subject by the layman. Each
of the relatively few scientific terms is explained
where first used in the text, and a glossary of common
geological terms has been appended.</p>

<p>The matter of illustrations has received very careful
attention, and only pictures, maps, and diagrams
are used which actually illustrate important features
of the text. A special point has been made to introduce
only cuts of simple construction comparatively
free from technicalities. Nearly every illustration
is accompanied by a really explanatory title.</p>

<p>A number of the pictures are from the author&rsquo;s
collection of photographs, and many of the line-cuts
have either been made or considerably modified by
the author. Among the numerous sources of illustrations,
special mention should be made of the
United States Geological Survey, the New York
State Museum, the American Museum of Natural
History, the University of Chicago Press, and various
individuals, full credit being given wherever due.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">E</span>ARTH features are not fixed. The person of
ordinary intelligence, surrounded as he is by a
great variety of physical features, is, unless he has
devoted some study to the subject, very likely to
regard those features as practically unchangeable,
and to think that they are now essentially as they
were in the beginning of the earth&rsquo;s history. Some
of the most fundamental ideas taught in this book
are that the physical features of the earth, as we
behold them to-day, represent but a single phase of
a very long-continued history; that significant
changes are now going on all around us; and that
we are able to interpret present-day earth features
only by an understanding of earth changes in the
past.</p>

<p><i>Geology</i>, meaning literally &ldquo;earth science,&rdquo; deals
with the history of the earth and its inhabitants as
revealed in the rocks. The science is very broad in
its scope. It treats of the processes by which the
earth has been, and is now being, changed; the
structure of the earth; the stages through which it
has passed; and the evolution of the organisms
which have lived upon it.</p>

<p><i>Geography</i> deals with the distribution of the
earth&rsquo;s physical features, in their relation to one
another, to the life of sea and land, and human life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">» 10 «</a></span>
and culture. It is the present and outward expression
of geological effects.</p>

<p>As a result of the work of many able students of
geology during the past century and a quarter, it
is now well established that our planet has a
definitely recorded history of many millions of
years, and that during the lapse of those eons, revolutionary
changes in earth features have occurred,
and also that there has been a vast succession of living
things which, from very early times, have gradually
passed from simple into more and more complex
forms. The physical changes and the organisms of
past ages have left abundant evidence of their character,
and the study of the rock formations has
shown that within them we have a fairly complete
record of the earth&rsquo;s history. Although very much
yet remains to be learned about this old earth, it is
a remarkable fact that man, through the exercise of
his highest faculty, has come to know so much concerning
it.</p>

<p>The following words, by the late Professor Barrell,
admirably summarize the significance of geological
history. "The great lesson taught by the study of
the outer crust is that the earth mother, like her children,
has attained her present form through ceaseless
change, which marks the pulse of life and
which shall cease only when her internal forces
slumber and the cloudy air and surf-bound ocean
no more are moving garments. The flowing landscapes
of geologic time may be likened to a kinetoscopic
panorama. The scenes transform from age
to age, as from act to act; seas and plains and
mountains of different types follow and replace each
other through time, as the traveler sees them succeed
each other in space. At times the drama
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">» 11 «</a></span>
hastens, and unusual rapidity of geologic action has,
in fact, marked those epochs since man has been a
spectator upon the earth. Science demonstrates that
mountains are transitory forms, but the eye of man
through all his lifetime sees no change, and his reason
is appalled at the conception of a duration so
vast that the milleniums of written history have not
accomplished the shifting of even one of the fleeting
views which blend into the moving picture."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Or in the words of Tennyson:</p>

<p class="p0" style="padding-left: 5em">
There rolls the deep where grew the tree.<br />
O, earth, what changes hast thou seen!<br />
There where the long street roars, hath been<br />
The stillness of the central sea.<br />
The hills are shadows, and they flow<br />
From form to form, and nothing stands;<br />
They melt like mist, the solid lands,<br />
Like clouds they shape themselves and go.<br />
</p>

<p>The following statement of some of the more
definite important conclusions regarding earth
changes may serve to make still clearer the general
scope of the science of geology. The evidences
upon which these conclusions are based are discussed
in various parts of this book. For untold
millions of years the rocks at and near the earth&rsquo;s
surface have been crumbling; streams have been
incessantly sawing into the lands; the sea has been
eating into continental masses; the winds have been
sculpturing desert lands; and, more intermittently
and locally, glaciers have plowed through mountain
valleys, and even great sheets of ice have spread
over considerable portions of continents. Throughout
geologic time, the crust of the earth has shown
marked instability. Slow upward and downward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">» 12 «</a></span>
movements of the lands relative to sea level have
been very common, in many cases amounting to
even thousands of feet. Various parts of the earth
have been notably affected by sudden movements
(resulting in earthquakes) along fractures in the
outer crust. During millions of years molten materials
have, at various times, been forced into the
earth&rsquo;s crust, and in many cases to its surface.
Mountain ranges have been brought forth and cut
down. The site of the Appalachian Mountains
was, millions of years ago, the bottom of a shallow
sea. Lakes have come and gone. The Great
Lakes have come into existence very recently
(geologically), that is to say, since the great Ice
Age. A study of stratified rocks of marine origin
shows that all, or nearly all, of the earth&rsquo;s surface
has at some time, or times, been covered by sea
water. Over certain districts the sea has transgressed
and retrogressed repeatedly. Organisms
have inhabited the earth for many millions of years.
In earlier known geologic time, the plants and animals
were comparatively simple and low in the scale
of organization, and through the succeeding ages
higher and more complex types were gradually
evolved until the highly organized forms of the
present time, including the human race, were
produced.</p>

<p>The rocks of the earth constitute the special field
of study for the geologist because they contain the
records of events through which the earth and its
inhabitants have passed during the millions of
years of time until their present conditions have
been reached. All the rocks of the earth&rsquo;s crust
may be divided into three great classes: <i>igneous</i>,
<i>sedimentary</i>, and <i>metamorphic</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">» 13 «</a></span></p>

<p><i>Igneous</i> rocks comprise all those which have ever
been in a molten condition, and of these we have
the <i>volcanic</i> rocks (for example, lavas), which have
cooled at or near the surface; <i>plutonic</i> rocks (for
example, granites), which have cooled in great
masses at considerable depths below the surface; and
the <i>dike</i> rocks which, when molten, have been forced
into fissures in the earth&rsquo;s crust and there cooled.</p>

<p><i>Sedimentary</i> rocks comprise all those which have
been deposited under water, except some wind-blown
deposits, and they are nearly always arranged
in layers (stratified). Such rocks are called
strata. They may be of mechanical origin such as
clay or mud which hardens to <i>shale</i>; sand, which
consolidates into <i>sandstone</i>; and gravel, which when
cemented becomes <i>conglomerate</i>. They may be of
organic origin such as limestone, most of which is
formed by the accumulation of calcareous shells;
<i>flint</i> and <i>chert</i>, which are accumulations of siliceous
shells; or <i>coal</i>, which is formed by the accumulation
of partly decayed organic matter. Or, finally, they
may be formed by chemical precipitation, as beds of
<i>salt</i>, <i>gypsum</i>, <i>bog iron ore</i>, etc.</p>

<p><i>Metamorphic</i> rocks include both sedimentary and
igneous rocks which have been notably changed
from their original condition. Traces or remains
of plants and animals preserved in the rocks are
known as fossils. The term originally meant anything
dug out of the earth, whether organic or inorganic,
but for many years it has been strictly
applied to organic remains. Many thousands of
species of fossils are known from rocks of all ages
except the oldest, and more are constantly being
brought to light, but these represent only a small
part of the life of past ages because relatively few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">» 14 «</a></span>
organic remains were deposited under conditions
favorable for preservation in fossil form. The fossils
in the rocks are, however, a fair average of the
groups of organisms to which they belong. It is
really remarkable that such a vast number of fossils
are imbedded in the rocks, and from a study
of these many fundamental conclusions regarding
the history of life on our planet may be drawn.</p>

<p>As early as the fifth century B. C., Xenophanes is
said to have observed fossil shells and plants in
the rocks of Paros, and to have attributed their
presence to incursions of the sea over the land.
Herodotus, about a century later, came to a similar
conclusion regarding fossil shells in the mountains
of Egypt. None of the ancients, however, seemed to
have the slightest conception of the significance of
fossils as time markers in the history of the earth.
(See <a href="#strata">discussion below</a>.)</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, distinguished writers held
curious views regarding fossils. Thus Avicenna
(980-1037) believed that fossils represented unsuccessful
attempts on the part of nature to change
inorganic materials into organisms within the earth
by a peculiar creative force (<i>vis plastica</i>). About
two centuries later, Albertus Magnus held a somewhat
similar view. Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519),
the famous artist, architect, and engineer, while engaged
in canal building in northern Italy, saw fossils
imbedded in the rocks, and concluded that these
were the remains of organisms which actually lived
in sea water which spread over the region. During
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, many
correctly held that fossils were really of organic
origin, but it was commonly taught that all fossils
represented remains of organisms of an earlier creation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">» 15 «</a></span>
which were buried in the rocks during the
great Deluge (Noah&rsquo;s Flood). William Smith
(1769-1839), of England, was, however, the first to
recognize the fundamental significance of fossils
for determining the relative ages of sedimentary
rocks. This discovery laid the foundation for the
determination of earth chronology which is of great
importance in the study of the history of the earth.
(See <a href="#strata">discussions below</a>.)</p>

<p>Organic remains, dating as far back as tens of
millions of years, have been preserved in the rocks of
the earth in various ways. A very common kind of
fossilization is the preservation of only the hard
parts of organisms. Thus the soft parts have disappeared
by decomposition, while the hard parts,
such as bones, shells, etc., remain. In many cases
practically complete skeletons of large and small
animals which lived millions of years ago have been
found intact in the rocks. Fossils which show none
of the original material, but only the shape or form,
are also very abundant. When sediment hardens
around an imbedded organism, and the organism
then decomposes or dissolves away, a cavity or fossil
mold only is left. Casts of organisms or parts
of them are formed by filling shells or molds with
sediment or with mineral matter carried in solution
by underground water. Only rarely have casts of
wholly soft animals been found in ancient rocks. In
other cases both original form and structure are
preserved, but none of the original material. This
is known as petrifaction which takes place when a
plant or hard part of an animal has been replaced,
particle by particle, by mineral matter from solution
in underground water. Not uncommonly organic
matter, such as wood, or inorganic matter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">» 16 «</a></span>
such as carbonate of lime shells, has been so perfectly
replaced that the original structures are preserved
almost as in life. The popular idea that
petrified wood is wood which has been changed
into stone is, of course, incorrect. It is doubtful if
flesh has ever been truly petrified. In many cases
mainly the carbon only of organisms has been preserved.
This is also true of plants where, under
conditions of slow chemical change or decomposition,
the hydrogen and oxygen mostly disappear,
leaving much of the carbon with original structures
often remarkably preserved. Fine examples are
fossil plants in the great coal-bearing strata. Much
more rarely entire organisms have been preserved
either by freezing or by natural embalmment. Most
remarkable are the species of mammoths and rhinoceroses,
extinct for thousands of years, bodies of
which, with flesh, hide, and hair still intact, have
been held in cold storage in the frozen soils of Siberia,
or other cases. Insects have been perfectly
preserved in amber, as, for example, in the Baltic
region. This amber is a hardened resin in which
the insects were caught while it was still soft and
exuding from the trees. Finally, we should mention
the preservation of tracks and trails of land and
water animals. Thousands of tracks of long-extinct
great reptiles occur in the sandstones and shales of
the Connecticut Valley of Massachusetts. The footprints
were made in soft sandy mud which hardened
and then became covered with more sediment.</p>

<p>Few fossils occur in other than the sedimentary
rocks. Most numerous, by far, are fossils in rocks
of marine origin, because on relatively shallow sea
bottoms, where sediments of the geologic ages have
largely accumulated, the conditions for fossilization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">» 17 «</a></span>
have been most favorable. Among the many conditions
which have produced great diversity in numbers
and distribution of marine organisms during
geologic time are temperature, depth of water, clearness
of water, nature of sea bottom, degree of salinity,
and food supply. River and lake deposits also
not uncommonly contain remains of organisms
which inhabited the waters, but also others which
were carried in. &ldquo;Surrounding trees drop their
leaves, flowers, and fruit upon the mud flats, insects
fall into the quiet waters, while quadrupeds are
mired in mud or quicksand and soon buried out of
sight. Flooded streams bring in quantities of vegetable
debris, together with carcasses of land animals
drowned by the sudden rise of the flood&rdquo; (W. B.
Scott).</p>

<p><a name="strata" id="strata"></a>In the study of the many changes which have
taken place in the history of the earth, a fundamental
consideration is the determination of the
relative ages of the rocks, especially the strata.
How can the geologist assign a rock formation of
any part of the earth to a particular age in the
history of the earth? How can it be proved that
certain rock formations in various parts of the earth
originated practically at the same time? There are
two important criteria. First, in any region where
the strata have not been disturbed from their normal
order, the older strata underlie the younger because
the underlying sediments must have been
deposited first. Now, the total thickness of the
stratified series of the earth has been estimated to
be no less than 200,000 feet and only a small part
of this is actually present in any given locality or
region. It is, therefore, evident that the order of
superposition of strata is in itself not sufficient for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">» 18 «</a></span>
the determination of the relative ages of all the
strata in even a considerable portion of a single continent,
not to mention its utter inadequacy in building
up the geological column of the whole earth.
When, however, the second criterion, namely, the
fossil content of the strata, is used in direct connection
with the order of superposition, we have the
real basis for determining the relative ages of strata
for all parts of the earth. The discovery of this
method was very largely due to the painstaking
field work in England by William Smith about
the beginning of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>It is a well-established fact that organisms have inhabited
the earth for many millions of years and
that, through the geologic ages, they have continuously
changed, with gradual development of higher
and higher types. Tens of thousands of species
have come and gone. Accepting this fact, it is then
clear that strata which were formed at notably different
times must contain notably different fossils,
while strata which accumulated at practically the
same time contain similar fossils, allowing, of course,
for reasonable differences in geographical distribution
of organisms as at the present time. Each
epoch of earth history or series of strata has its
characteristic assemblage of organisms. In short,
&ldquo;a geological chronology is constructed by carefully
determining, first of all, the order of superposition
of the stratified rocks, and next by learning the fossils
characteristic of each group of strata....
The order of succession among the fossils is determined
from the order of superposition of the strata
in which they occur. When that succession has been
thus established, it may be employed as a general
standard&rdquo; (W. B. Scott). It should, however, be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">» 19 «</a></span>
borne in mind that precise contemporaneity of strata
in widely separated districts can rarely, if ever, be
determined because of the very great length of geologic
time and the general slowness of the evolution
of organisms. Rocks carrying remarkably similar
fossils may really be several thousand years different
in age; but this is, indeed, a very small limit
of error when one considers the vast antiquity of
the earth. Much very accurate and satisfactory
work has been done, especially in Europe and North
America, in correlating strata and assigning them
to their places in the geological time table (see <a href="#Page_20">below</a>),
but a vast amount of work yet remains to be
done before the task is complete.</p>

<p>Certain types or species of organisms are much
more useful than others in the determination of
earth chronology. Best of all for world-wide correlations
are species which were widely distributed
and which persisted for relatively short times.
Thus any species which lived in the surface waters
of the ocean and was easily distributed over wide
areas, while, at the same time, it existed as such
only a short time, is the best type of chronologic
indicator.</p>

<p>The known history of the earth has been more or
less definitely divided into great eras and lesser
periods and epochs, constituting what may be called
the geologic time scale. In the accompanying table
the era and period names, except those representing
earlier time, are mostly world-wide in their
usage. Epoch names, being more or less locally
applied, are omitted from the table. Very conservative
estimates of the length of time represented by
the eras and the most characteristic general features
of the life of the main divisions are also given.</p>

<p>The length of time represented by human history
is very short compared to the vast time of known
geological history. The one is measured by thousands
of years, while the other must be measured by
tens of millions of years. Just as we may roughly
divide human history into certain ages according
to some notable person, nation, principle, or force as,
for example, the &ldquo;Age of Pericles,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Roman
Period,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Age of the French Revolution,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;Age of Electricity,&rdquo; so geologic history may be subdivided
according to great predominant physical or
organic phenomena, such as &ldquo;the Appalachian Mountain
Revolution&rdquo; (toward the end of the Paleozoic
era), the &ldquo;Age of Fishes&rdquo; (Devonian period), or
the &ldquo;Age of Reptiles&rdquo; (Mesozoic era).</p>

<p>In the study of earth history, as in the study of
human history, it is important to distinguish between
events and records of events. Historical events are
continuous, but they are by no means all recorded.
Records of events are often interrupted and seemingly
sharply separated from each other.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></p>

<p class="caption3">WEATHERING AND EROSION</p>

<div class="dropcap">A</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">A</span>ll rocks at and near the surface of the earth
crumble or decay. The term &ldquo;weathering&rdquo; includes
all the processes whereby rocks are broken up,
decomposed, or dissolved. A mass of very hard and
seemingly indestructible granite, taken from a
quarry, will, in a very short time, geologically considered,
crumble (<a href="#Plate_1a">Plate 1</a>). During the short span
of the ordinary human life weathering effects are
generally of very little consequence, but during the
long ages of geologic time the various processes of
weathering have been slowly and ceaselessly at work
upon the outer crust of the earth, and such tremendous
quantities of rock material have been broken
up that the lands of the earth have everywhere been
profoundly affected.</p>

<p>Most of us have noticed buildings and monuments
in which the stones show marked effects of weathering.
A good case in point is Westminster Abbey,
London, in which many of the stones are badly
weathering, some of the more ornamental parts having
crumbled beyond recognition since the building
was erected in the thirteenth century. In many
countries, tombstones and monuments only one or
two centuries old are so badly weathered that the inscriptions
are scarcely if at all legible.</p>

<p>What are some of the processes of nature whereby
rocks are weathered? In cold countries, and often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">» 23 «</a></span>
in mountains of generally mild climate regions, the
alternate freezing and thawing of water is a potent
agency in breaking up rocks where the soils are thin
or absent. On freezing, water expands about one-tenth
of its volume and exerts the enormous pressure
of over 2,000 pounds per square inch. Nearly
all relatively hard rock formations are separated
into more or less distinct blocks by natural cracks
called &ldquo;joints&rdquo; (<a href="#Plate_8a">Plate 8</a>). Very commonly the rocks
also contain minute crevices, fissures, and pores. Repeated
freezing and thawing of water which finds
its way into such openings finally causes even the
most resistant rocks to break up into smaller and
smaller fragments. A very striking example of difference
in climatic effect upon a given rock mass is
the obelisk in Central Park, New York. For many
centuries this famous monument stood practically
without change in the dry, frostless climate of
Egypt, but very soon after its removal to the moist,
frosty climate of New York, it began to crumble
so rapidly that it was necessary to cover it with a
coating of glaze to protect it from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Temperature change, especially in dry regions, is
also an important agency for mechanical breaking
up of rocks. On high mountains and on deserts, a
daily range of temperature of from 70 degrees to
80 degrees is frequent. Due to heat absorption,
rocks in desert regions, during the day, not uncommonly
reach temperatures of fully 120 degrees, while
during the night, due to heat radiation, their temperature
falls greatly. During the heating of the
outer portion of the rock, the various minerals each
expand differently, thus setting up a series of
stresses and strains tending to cause the minerals to
pull apart. The outer portions of the rocks which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">» 24 «</a></span>
are subjected to unstable and relatively rapid temperature
changes, often crack or peel off in slabs or
flakes, this process being called exfoliation. Stone
Mountain in Georgia, and some of the mountains
of the southern Sierra Nevada range in California,
are excellent examples of mountains which are being
rounded off by exfoliation. The principle is the
same as that which causes the &ldquo;spalling&rdquo; of stones
in buildings during fires.</p>

<p>Masses of débris consisting of more or less angular
rock fragments of all sizes commonly occur at the
bases of cliffs and mountains. They represent
materials which have weathered off the ledges
mainly by frost action and temperature changes.</p>

<p>Where electrical storms are frequent, lightning
often shatters portions of rock ledges. Many such
cases have come under the writer&rsquo;s observation in
the Adirondack Mountains of New York. The total
effect of lightning as a weathering agency is, however,
relatively small.</p>

<p>Another minor weathering effect is the mechanical
action of plants. The principle is well illustrated
by the breaking or tilting of sidewalks by the wedging
action of the growing roots of trees. In many
places the roots of plants growing in cracks in rocks,
exert powerful pressure causing the rocks or blocks
of rocks to wedge apart.</p>

<p>Let us now briefly consider some of the chemical
processes of weathering. The solvent effect of perfectly
pure water upon rocks is very slight and
slow. But such water is not found in nature because
certain atmospheric gases, especially oxygen
and carbonic acid gas, are always present in it, and
they notably increase the solvent power of the water.
Such water has the power to slowly but completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">» 25 «</a></span>
dissolve the common rock called limestone which
consists of carbonate of lime. This material is then
carried away by the streams. Rocks, like certain
sandstones which contain carbonate of lime cementing
material, are caused to crumble due to removal
of the cement in solution. Carbonic acid gas in
water also has the power to chemically alter various
minerals in many common rocks and thus the rocks
fall apart and the carbonates which result from the
action usually are carried away in solution. One of
the most important changes of this kind takes place
when the very common mineral feldspar is attacked
by water containing carbonic acid gas and the mineral
alters to a soluble carbonate, kaolin (or clay)
and silica.</p>

<p>The oxygen, both of the air and that which is contained
in water, is a very important chemical agent
of decomposition of many rocks. Water at the surface
and the upper part of the crust of the earth as
well as moisture in the air are also important chemical
agents which bring about rock decay. We are all
familiar with the rusting of iron which is due to the
chemical union of the iron with oxygen, thus forming
an iron oxide which in turn commonly unites with
water from air or earth. Now, many rocks contain
iron, not as such, but held in combination with other
substances in the form of various minerals, and this
iron of the rocks, where subjected to the oxygen and
moisture of air or water, slowly unites with the
oxygen and water to form a hydrated iron oxide
which is essentially iron-rust. The minerals containing
considerable iron are, therefore, decomposed
and the rocks crumble. There are various
iron oxides, usually more or less hydrated, ranging
in color from red through brown to yellow, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">» 26 «</a></span>
these constitute probably the most common and
striking colors of the rocks of the earth. The gorgeously
colored Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone
River is a very fine example of large scale coloring
due to development of much hydrated oxide of iron
during the weathering of lava rock, the process having
been aided by the action of heated underground
waters.</p>

<p>Most of the soils of the earth are the direct result
of weathering. Important exceptions are soils
which have been transported by the action of water,
ice, or wind. Although the process of weathering
is very slow and relatively superficial, it is, nevertheless,
true that in many places, the products of
weathering form faster than they can be carried
away. Such weathered materials accumulate in
their place of origin to form soils. The upper few
hundred feet of the earth&rsquo;s crust is everywhere more
or less fractured and porous and the rocks are there
affected in varying degrees by most of the ordinary
agents of weathering. In such cases, outside the
areas which were recently covered by ice during
the great Ice Age, it is common to find the loose soil
grading downward into rotten rock, and this in turn
into the fresh practically unaltered bedrock. Soils
of this kind are generally not more than ten or
twenty feet deep, though under exceptional conditions,
as in parts of Brazil, they attain depths of
several hundred feet.</p>

<p>In order to make still clearer some of the above
principles of weathering and also to give the reader
some understanding of the most common types of
residual soils, we shall consider what happens to a
few rather definite types of ordinary rocks when
they are subjected to weathering. A very simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">» 27 «</a></span>
case is that of a sandstone, the mineral grains
(mostly quartz) of which are held together by carbonate
of lime. The lime simply dissolves and is
carried away, while many of the mineral grains may
remain to form a soil of nearly pure sand. Where
oxide of iron forms the cementing material, the rock
yields less readily to weathering, and the sandy soil
will be yellowish brown or red according to the
climate. Another simple case is that of limestone
which when perfectly pure yields no soil because it
is all soluble. Pure limestone is, however, rare, and
the various mineral impurities in it, being to a considerable
degree insoluble, tend to remain to form
a residual soil which may vary from sandy to clayey,
and usually brown or red due to the setting free of
oxides of iron. According to one estimate a thickness
of about 100 feet of a certain fairly impure
limestone formation in Virginia must weather
to yield a layer of soil one foot thick. Soils of this
kind, which are usually rich, are common in many
limestone valleys of the Appalachian Mountains. In
the case of shale rock, which is hardened mud, the
cementing materials are removed, some chemical
changes in the minerals may take place, and the rock
crumbles to a claylike soil. What happens to a very
hard, resistant igneous rock like granite when attacked
by the weather? Such a rock always consists
mainly of the two very common minerals feldspar
and quartz, usually with smaller amounts of
other minerals such as mica, hornblende, augite, or
magnetite. The feldspar, which when fresh is
harder than steel, slowly yields when attacked by
water containing carbonic acid gas and crumbles
or decays to a mixture of kaolin (clay), carbonate of
potash, and silica (quartz). Clay is an important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">» 28 «</a></span>
constituent of most good soils, while the carbonate
of potash is essential as a food for most plants. Due
to yielding of the grains or crystals of feldspar, the
granite falls apart (see <a href="#Plate_1a">Plate 1</a>). The grains of
quartz remain chemically unchanged, though they
may be more or less broken by changes of temperature,
and the other minerals, which are mostly iron-bearing,
yield more or less to weathering, resulting
in a variety of products, among which are oxides of
iron. A typical granite, therefore, gives rise to a
good heavy soil which is yellow, brown or red according
to climate. Such granite soils are common in
many parts of the Piedmont Plateau from Maryland
to Georgia. Most of the dark-colored igneous rocks,
like ordinary basaltic lava, contain much feldspar,
various iron-bearing minerals, and little or no quartz.
Such rocks yield to the weather like granite but, because
of lack of quartz, the soils are more clayey.
Rich soils of this kind occur in the great lava fields
of the northwestern United States and in the
Hawaiian Islands.</p>

<p>The importance of the breaking down of feldspar
under the influence of the weather, as above described,
not only from the standpoint of soil development,
but also as regards the wearing down of the
lands of the earth, is difficult to overemphasize because
that mineral is by far the most abundant constituent
of the earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;erosion&rdquo; is one of the most important
in geologic science. It comprises all the processes
whereby the lands of the earth are worn down. It
involves the breaking up of earth material, and its
transportation through the agency of water, ice, or
wind. Weathering, including the various subprocesses
as above described, is a very important process
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">» 29 «</a></span>
of erosion. By this process much rock material
is got into condition for transportation. Another
process of erosion, called &ldquo;corrasion,&rdquo; consists in
the rubbing or bumping of rocks fragments of all
sizes carried by water, ice, or wind against the general
country rock, thus causing the latter to be gradually
worn away. A fine illustration of exceedingly
rapid corrasion of very hard rock was that of the
Sill tunnel in Austria, which was paved with granite
blocks several feet thick. Water carrying large
quantities of rock fragments over the pavement at
high velocity caused the granite blocks to be worn
through in only one year. Ordinarily in nature, however,
the rate of wear is much slower than this.
Pressure exerted upon the country rock by any
agency of transportation may cause relatively loose
joint blocks, into which most rock formations are
separated, to be pushed away. This process, called
&ldquo;plucking,&rdquo; is especially effective in the case of flowing
ice.</p>

<p class="caption3">STREAM WORK</p>

<div class="dropcap">M</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">M</span>OST streams are incessantly at work cutting or
eroding their way into the earth&rsquo;s crust and
carrying off the products of weathering. By this
means the general level of lands is gradually being
reduced to nearer and nearer sea level. Base level
of erosion is reached when any stream has eroded
to its greatest possible depth, and a whole region is
said to be base-leveled when, by the action of
streams, it has been reduced to a practically flat
condition. A region of this kind is known as
a &ldquo;peneplain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To one who has not seriously considered the matter,
the power of even moderately swift water to
transport rock débris seems incredible. A well-established
law of transportation by running water
is that the transporting power of a current varies
as the sixth power of its velocity. For example, a
current which is just able to move a rock fragment
of a given size will, when its velocity is merely doubled,
be able to move along a piece of similar rock
sixty-four times as large! That this must be the
case may be readily proved as follows: A current
of given velocity is just able to move a block of
rock, say, of one cubic inch in the form of a cube.
A cubic block sixty-four times as large has a face of
sixteen square inches. By doubling the velocity of
the current, therefore, twice as much water must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">» 31 «</a></span>
strike each of the sixteen square inches of the face
of the larger block with twice the force, thus exerting
sixty-four times the power against the face of
the larger block, or enough to move it along. This
surprising law accounts for the fact that in certain
floods, like the one which rushed over Johnstown,
Pennsylvania, in 1889, locomotives, massive iron
bridges, and great bowlders were swept along with
great velocity. It is obvious, then, that ordinarily
swift rivers in time of flood accomplish far more
work of erosion (especially transportation) than during
many days or even some months of low water.</p>

<p>Few people have the slightest idea as to the
enormous amount of earth material which the
rivers are carrying into the sea each year. The
burden carried by the Mississippi River has been
carefully studied for many years. Each year this
river discharges about 400,000,000 tons of material
in suspension; 120,000,000 tons in solution; and 40,000,000
tons rolled along the bottom. This all represents
earth material eroded from the drainage
basin of the river. It is sufficient to cover a square
mile 325 feet deep, or if placed in ordinary freight
cars it would require a train reaching around the
earth several times to contain it. Since the drainage
basin of the Mississippi covers about 1,250,000
square miles, it is, therefore, evident that this
drainage area is being worn down at the average
rate of about one foot in 3,840 years, and this is
perhaps, a fair average for the rivers of the earth.
The Ganges River, being unusually favorably situated
for rapid erosion, wears down its drainage
basin about one foot in 1,750 years. It has been
estimated that nearly 800,000,000 tons of material
are annually carried into the sea by the rivers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">» 32 «</a></span>
the United States. According to this the country, as
a whole, is being cut down at the rate of about
one foot in 9,000 years. In arriving at this figure it
should, of course, be borne in mind that the average
level of hundreds of thousands of square miles
of the western United States, particularly the so-called
Great Basin, is practically not being reduced
at all because none of the streams there reach
the sea.</p>

<p>Deposition of sediment is an important natural
consequence of erosion. The destination of most
streams is the sea, and where tides are relatively
slight the sediments discharged mostly accumulate
relatively near the mouths of the rivers in the form
of flat, fan-shaped delta deposits. Some rivers, like
the Ganges, which carry such unusual quantities of
sediment, are able to construct deltas in spite of
considerable tides. Deltas also form in lakes. In
most cases, however, rivers enter the sea where
there are considerable tides and their loads are more
widely spread over the marginal sea bottom. But
in many cases some of the sediment does not reach
the mouth of the stream. It is, instead, deposited
along its course either where the velocity is sufficiently
checked, as is the case over many flood-plain
areas of rivers, or where a heavily loaded,
relatively swift stream has its general velocity
notably diminished. An excellent example of the
latter type of stream is the Platte River, which is
swift and loaded with sediment in its descent from
the Rocky Mountains, but, on reaching the relatively
more nearly level Nebraska country, it has its
current sufficiently checked to force it to deposit
sediment and build up its channel along many miles
of its course, and this in spite of the fact that it
still maintains a considerable current. In a mountainous
arid region a more or less intermittent
stream at times of flood becomes heavily loaded with
rock débris and rushes down the mountain side. On
reaching the valley floor the velocity is greatly
checked and most of the load is deposited at the
base of the mountain, successive accumulations of
such materials, called alluvial cones or fans, having
not uncommonly built up to depths of hundreds, or
even several thousand feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">» 33 «</a></span></p>

<p>Any newly formed land surface, like a recently
drained lake bed or part of the marginal sea bottom
which has been raised into land, has a drainage
system developed upon it. In the early or
youthful stage of such a new land area lying well
above sea level, under ordinary climatic conditions
a few streams only form and these tend to follow
the natural or initial slope of the land. These
streams carve out narrow, steep-sided valleys, and
all of them are actively engaged in cutting down
their channels, or, in other words, none of them
have reached base level, and flood plains and meandering
curves are therefore lacking. During this
youthful stage there are no sharp drainage divides;
gorges and waterfalls are not uncommonly present;
and the relief of the land in general is not rugged.
A good example of youthful topography is the region
around Fargo, North Dakota, which is part of the
bed of a great recently drained lake. The Grand
Canyon of the Yellowstone River is an excellent
illustration of a youthful valley cut in a high plateau
of geologically recent origin. (<a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2.</a>)</p>

<p>As time goes on, a region in youth gradually gives
way to a region in maturity, during which stage the
maximum number (usually a network) of streams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">» 34 «</a></span>
in broader V-shaped valleys have developed; divisions
of drainage are sharp; the maximum ruggedness
of relief has developed; the larger streams
only have cut down so near base level that winding
(meandering) courses and flood plains are well
developed along them; and waterfalls and gorges
are rarely present. An almost perfect example of
a region in maturity is that around Charleston,
West Virginia.</p>

<p>The old-age stage develops next in the history of
the region, during which only a moderate number of
streams remain, most of these being at or close to
base level so that sweeping curves or meanders
(<a href="#Plate_4a">Plate 4</a>) and cut-off meanders or &ldquo;ox bows&rdquo; and
wide flood plains are characteristic and common.
The relief is greatly subdued and the term &ldquo;rolling
country&rdquo; might be applied to the moderately hilly
region. Divisions of drainage are, of course, not at
all sharp and the valleys are wide and shallow. Oxbow
lakes are common, but gorges and waterfalls
are absent. A region typical of old-age topography
is that around Caldwell, Kansas.</p>

<p>Finally, after the remaining low hills have been
cut down, the region is in the condition of a broad
monotonous plain, practically devoid of relief, over
which the sluggish streams pursue very winding,
more or less shifting or indefinite courses. For the
attainment of this final stage (called a &ldquo;peneplain&rdquo;)
in the normal cycle of erosion a proportionately
very long time is necessary, because the rate of erosion
becomes slower and slower as the region is being
cut down. Then, too, some change of level
between the land and the sea is very likely to take
place before the peneplain stage is reached. It is
doubtful if any extensive region was ever brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">» 35 «</a></span>
to the condition of a perfect peneplain. Some masses
of more resistant or more favorably situated
rocks are almost sure to maintain at least moderate
heights above the general plain level. Geologically
recently upraised, fairly well developed peneplains
are southern New England and the great region of
eastern Canada. The remarkably even sky lines of
these regions mark the peneplain level before the
uplift took place, and occasionally masses, called
&ldquo;monadnocks&rdquo; from Mount Monadnock in southern
New Hampshire, rise above the general level. The
valleys in such an uplifted peneplain region have
been carved out by streams since the uplift began.
We have positive evidence that more or less well-developed
peneplains of considerable extent existed
in various parts of the earth at various times during
the many millions of years of known earth
history.</p>

<p>The normal cycle of erosion which, as outlined
above, tends toward the peneplain condition may be
interrupted at any stage by other processes. An
excellent case in point is the upper Mississippi
Valley, which had reached the old-age stage, even
approximating a peneplain, just before the great
Ice Age. Then, during the withdrawal of the vast
sheet of ice from the region toward the close of
the Ice Age, extensive deposits (moraines, etc.) of
glacial débris were left irregularly strewn over the
country, giving rise to many low hills, lake basins,
and altered drainage lines, in some cases with resultant
gorge development. Some distinct features
of a youthful topography are, therefore, plastered
over what was otherwise a region well along in old
age. The general district around the Dells of Wisconsin
River well illustrates this principle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">» 36 «</a></span></p>

<p>Changes in level between land and sea which
take place during the erosion of a region may also
disturb the normal cycle of erosion. For example,
a region in old age may be considerably upraised so
that the streams have their velocities notably increased.
Such a region is said to be &ldquo;rejuvenated&rdquo;
and the streams, which are revived in activity, begin
to cut youthful valleys in the bottom of the old ones
and, after a time, the general surface of the region is
subjected to vigorous erosion and a new cycle of
erosion will be carried out unless interfered with
in some way, as by relative change of level between
the land and the sea. In this connection the
history of the topography in the general vicinity of
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, may be of interest by
way of illustration of the principle just described.
The long, narrow, parallel Appalachian Mountain
ridges there rise to about the same level, causing a
remarkably even sky line as viewed from one of the
summits. This even sky line marks approximately
the surface of what was a peneplain late in the
Mesozoic era. Early in the succeeding Cenozoic era,
the broad peneplain was notably upraised to nearly
the present altitudes of the ridge tops. The revived
Susquehanna River left the old course which it had
on the peneplain surface, and began to carve out
its present valley, while tributaries (subsequent
streams) to it developed along belts of weaker rock
and thus they formed the present parallel valleys
separated by belts of more resistant rocks which
stand out as ridges. In this way, the mature stage of
topography was reached. Very recently, geologically,
the region has been rejuvenated enough to
cause the larger streams to appreciably sink their
channels below the general valley floors. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">» 37 «</a></span>
reader will find a general discussion of movements
of the earth&rsquo;s crust in a succeeding chapter.</p>

the contour lines on the sea floor. Figures indicate depth of water in
fathoms. Geologically recent sinking of the land has caused the
&ldquo;drowning&rdquo; of the river valley. (Coast and Geodetic Survey).</div>
</div>

<p>If, for example, a region along the seaboard has
reached the mature stage of erosion, and the land
notably subsides relative to sea level, the tidewater
will enter the lower valleys to form estuaries and
the valleys are said to be &ldquo;drowned.&rdquo; The large
streams, or at least their lower courses, are thus
obliterated and also the general erosion of the
region is distinctly diminished. The recently
sunken coast of Maine well illustrates the idea of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">» 38 «</a></span>
&ldquo;drowned valleys.&rdquo; The drowned valley of the
lower Hudson River is another fine example.</p>

the upper waters of Beaverdam Creek in Virginia. The abandoned
valley of the creek across Blue Ridge is now called a &ldquo;wind gap.&rdquo;
(After B. Willis.)</div>
</div>

<p>What is termed stream &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; is of special
interest in connection with stream work. By this
is meant the stealing of one stream or part of a
stream by another. We shall here explain only one
of the various ways by which stream capture may
be effected. One of two fairly active streams, flowing
roughly parallel to each other, is more favorably
situated and has cut its channel deeper. Its
tributaries are, therefore, more favorable to extension
of headwaters and, in time, one of its tributaries
eats back far enough to tap a branch of the
less favorably situated stream so that the waters of
this branch are diverted into the more favorably
situated stream. The Shenandoah River of Virginia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">» 39 «</a></span>
has been such a pirate. This river developed as a
tributary of the Potomac. By headward extension
toward the south, the Shenandoah finally tapped and
diverted the upper waters of the smaller, less favorably
situated Beaverdam Creek. The notch or
so-called &ldquo;wind gap&rdquo; through which the upper
waters of Beaverdam Creek formerly flowed across
the Blue Ridge is still plainly visible. Such abandoned
water gaps, known as &ldquo;wind gaps,&rdquo; are
common in the central Appalachian Mountain
region.</p>

<p>A remarkable type of river is one which has been
able to maintain its course through a barrier, even
a mountain range, which has been built across it.
Thus, the Columbia River, after flowing many miles
across the great lava plateau, has maintained its
course right across the growing Cascade Range by
cutting a deep canyon while the mountain uplift
has been in progress. In a similar manner the
Ogden River of Utah has kept its westward course
by cutting a deep canyon into the Wasatch Range
which has geologically recently, though slowly,
risen across its path. In no other way can
we possibly explain the fact that such a river,
rising on one side of a high mountain range, cuts
right across it.</p>

<p>A feature of minor though considerable popular
interest is the development of &ldquo;potholes&rdquo; by stream
action. Where eddies occur, in rather active
streams, rock fragments of varying sizes may be
whirled around in such manner as to corrode or
grind the bedrock, resulting in the development of
cylinder-shaped &ldquo;potholes.&rdquo; Such holes vary in
diameter up to fifty feet or more in very exceptional
cases. In the production of large &ldquo;potholes&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">» 40 «</a></span>
many rock fragments are worn away and new ones
supplied to continue the work. Locally, some stream
beds are honeycombed with &ldquo;potholes.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Grand Canyon, Arizona. (From Darton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Story of the Grand Canyon.&rdquo;)</div>
</div>

<p>Strikingly narrow and deep valleys, called gorges
and canyons, are rather exceptional features of
stream action. Most wonderful of all features of
this kind is the Grand Canyon of the Colorado
River in Arizona. In fact, this canyon takes high
rank among the most remarkable works of nature.
The canyon is over 200 miles long, from 4,000 to
6,000 feet deep, and from 8 to 15 miles wide. Contrary
to popular opinion, this mighty canyon is not
a result of some violent process, such as volcanic
action, or the sudden sinking of part of the earth&rsquo;s
crust. Nor is it the result of the scouring action of
a great glacier. It is simply a result of the operation
of the ordinary processes of erosion where the
conditions have been exceptionally favorable. Some
of the favorable conditions have been, and are, a
large volume of very swift water (Colorado River)
continually charged with an abundance of rock
fragments for the work of corrasion, and a great
thickness of rock which the river must cut through
before reaching base-level. Aridity of climate also
tends to preserve the canyon form. The whole
work has been accomplished in very late geological
time, and the tremendous volume of rock which has
been weathered and eroded to produce the canyon
has all been carried away by the Colorado River and
accumulated in the great delta deposit near where
the river empties into the Gulf of California. Even
now the canyon is growing deeper and wider because
the very active Colorado River is still from
2,000 to 3,000 feet above sea level. Standing on the
southern rim near Grand Canyon station at an altitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">» 41 «</a><br /><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">» 42 «</a></span>
of nearly 7,000 feet, and looking down into the
canyon, one beholds a vast maze of side canyons,
high, vertical rock walls which follow very sinuous
courses, giving rise to a steplike topography, and
countless rock pinnacles, towers, and mesas often of
mountain-like proportions. The side canyons are the
result of erosion by tributaries to the main river
which have gradually developed and worked headward
as the main river has cut down. The mountain-like
sculptured forms which rise out of the
canyon are erosion remnants, or, in other words,
masses of rock which were more favorably situated
against erosion by either the main river or
any of its tributaries. All of the rocks of the
broader, main portions of the canyon are strata of
Paleozoic age, arranged as a vast pile of almost
horizontal layers, including sandstone, limestone,
and shale. Some of these layers, being distinctly
more resistant than others, stand out in the canyon
wall in the form of conspicuous cliffs, in some cases
hundreds of feet high. The very striking color bands
(mostly light gray, red, and greenish gray), which
may be traced in and out along the canyon sides, represent
the outcropping edges of variously colored
rock layers. Far down in the canyon lies the steep-sided,
V-shaped inner gorge, or canyon which is
fully 1,000 feet deep. The rocks are there not
ordinary strata, but rather metamorphic and
igneous rocks, mostly dark gray, not in layers, and
about uniformly resistant to erosion. There is
reason to believe that this inner gorge has developed
mainly since a distinct renewed uplift (rejuvenation)
of the Colorado Plateau after the river began
its canyon cutting. The narrow, steep-sided inner
gorge may thus be readily accounted for and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">» 43 «</a></span>
general lack of steplike
forms on its sides
is due to essential uniformity
of the rock
material as regards resistance
to erosion.</p>

for its combined
narrowness and depth.
It is a steep V-shaped
canyon whose maximum
depth is 6,900
feet, carved out in
mostly solid granite
by the action of weathering
and running water.
Some idea of the
vast antiquity of the
earth may be gleaned
from the fact that
this tremendously deep
canyon has been produced
by erosion in
one of the most resistant
of all known rocks
in very late geologic
time! Conditions favorable
for cutting this
canyon have been volume
and swiftness of
water and a liberal supply
of grinding tools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">» 44 «</a></span></p>

<p>Among the many other great canyons of the
western United States brief mention may be made
of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River in the
National Park. The plateau into which the river
has cut its steep-sided, narrow, V-shaped canyon,
with a maximum depth of 1,200 feet, has been
geologically recently built up by outpourings of
vast sheets of lava. The large volume of very swift
water, aided by decomposition and weakening of
the ordinarily very hard rock by the action of the
hot springs, has been able to carve out this deep
canyon practically within the last period of earth
history. The deepening process is still vigorously
in progress. The wonderful coloring of the rock,
mostly in tones of yellow and brown, is due to the
hydrated iron oxides developed during the decay of
the iron-bearing minerals of the lava, the chemical
action having been greatly aided by the action of the
hot waters. (See <a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2</a>.)</p>

<p>In regard to its origin, the marvelous Yosemite
Valley, or canyon, falls in a somewhat different
category, and it is discussed beyond in connection
with the work of ice. Suffice it to say here that
running water has been a very important factor in
its origin.</p>

<p>In New York and New England there are many
gorges which have developed by the action of running
water since the Great Ice Age. Famous among
these are Ausable Chasm and Watkins Glen of New
York, and the Flume in the White Mountains of
New Hampshire.</p>

</div>

<p>Before leaving our discussion of the work of running
water, we should briefly consider waterfalls.
True waterfalls originate in a number of ways.
Most common of all is what may be termed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">» 45 «</a></span>
&ldquo;Niagara type&rdquo; of waterfall. Niagara Falls merit
more than passing mention not only because of their
scenic grandeur, but also because of the unusual
number of geologic principles which their origin
and history so clearly illustrate. Niagara Falls are
divided into two main portions, the Canadian, or
so-called &ldquo;Horseshoe Fall,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;American
Fall,&rdquo; separated by a large island. The crest of the
American Fall is about 1,000 feet long and nearly
straight, while the crest of the Canadian Fall is
notably curved inward upstream, and it is about
3,000 feet long. The height of the Falls is 167 feet.
Downstream from the Falls there is a very steep-sided
gorge about 200 feet deep and seven miles long.
The exposed rocks of the region are nearly horizontal
layers of limestone underlain with shales. Relatively
more resistant limestone forms the crest of
the falls, and directly underneath are the much
weaker shales. Herein lies the principle of this
type of waterfall because, due to weathering and
the swirling action of the water, the weaker underlying
rocks erode faster, thus causing the overlying
rock to overhang so that from time to time blocks
of it already more or less separated by cracks
(joints), fall down and are mostly carried away in
the swift current. Thus the waterfall maintains
itself while it steadily retreats upstream. Careful
estimates based upon observations made between
1827 and 1905 show that the Canadian Fall retreated
at the rate of from three to five feet per year,
while the American Fall retreated during the same
time at the rate of only several inches per year. It
has been well established that Niagara Falls came
into existence soon after the ice of the great Ice
Age had retreated from the district. The falls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">» 46 «</a></span>
started by plunging over a limestone escarpment,
situated at what is now the mouth of the gorge
seven miles downstream from the present falls. If
we consider the rate of recession of the falls to have
been always five feet per year, the length of time required
to cut the gorge would be something over
7,000 years. But the problem is not so simple,
because we know that, at the time of, or shortly
after, the beginning of the falls, the upper Great
Lakes drained farther north and not over the falls;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">» 47 «</a></span>
and that this continued for a considerable, though
unknown, length of time. During this interval the
volume of water in Niagara River was notably
diminished, and hence the recession of the falls
must have been slower. On the other hand, judging
by the width of the gorge, the length of the crest
of the falls has generally been considerably less than
at present, which in turn means greater concentration
of water over the crest and more rapid wear.
Various factors considered, the best estimates for
the age of the falls vary from 7,000 to 50,000 years,
an average being about 25,000 years. Although this
figure is not precise, it is, nevertheless, of considerable
geologic interest because it shows that the age
of Niagara Falls (and gorge) is to be reckoned in
some tens of thousands of years, rather than hundreds
of thousands or millions of years. Although
waterfalls of the Niagara type are the most common
of all, it is by no means necessary that the
particular rocks should be limestone and shale.</p>

<p>Another common kind of waterfall may be
termed the &ldquo;Yosemite type,&rdquo; so named from the
high falls in the Yosemite Valley of California. At
the great falls of the Yosemite, the rock is a homogeneous
granite and the undermining process does
not operate. Yosemite Creek first plunges vertically
over a granite cliff for 1,430 feet to form the Upper
Falls, which must rank among the very highest of
all true water falls. The water then descends about
800 feet by cascading through a narrow gorge, after
which it makes a final vertical plunge of over 300
feet. A brief history of the falls is about as follows.
A great steep-sided V-shaped canyon several thousand
feet deep had been carved out by the action of
the Merced River which now flows through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">» 48 «</a></span>
valley. Then, during the Ice Age, a mighty glacier
plowed through the canyon, filling it to overflowing.
The granite of this district having been unusually
highly fractured by great vertical joint cracks was
relatively easy prey for ice erosion. Due to its great
weight, the erosive power of the ice was most potent
toward the bottom, successive joint blocks were removed,
and the valley was thus widened and the
sides steepened or even commonly made practically
vertical. (See <a href="#Plate_6">Plate 6.</a>) After the melting of the
ice, certain of the streams, like Yosemite Creek and
Bridal Veil Creek, were forced to enter the valley
by plunging over great perpendicular, granite cliffs
which are in reality joint faces. This type
of waterfall does not retreat, but it constantly
diminishes in height by cutting into the crest. A
number of other high falls of this kind occur in
the Yosemite region, and also in other mountain
valleys which formerly contained glaciers, as
in the Canadian Rockies, the Alps, and Norway,
the rocks in these regions being of various kinds.</p>

<p>In the case of the &ldquo;Yellowstone type&rdquo; of waterfall
a different principle is involved, namely, a distinctly
harder or more resistant mass of rock which
extends vertically across the channel of the stream.
At the Great Falls of the Yellowstone a mass of
relatively fresh, hard lava lies athwart the course of
the river, while just below it the lava has been much
weakened by decomposition. The harder rock therefore
acts as a barrier, while, in the course of time,
the weak rock on the downstream side has been
worn away until a waterfall 308 feet high has developed.
This waterfall does not retreat very appreciably,
but it is probably increasing in height, due
both to the scouring action of the water at the base
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">» 49 «</a></span>
of the fall and the unusual clearness of the river
water here, thus causing little wear at the crest. It
should be noted, in this connection, that the channel
just on the upstream side of the barrier cannot
be cut down faster than the top of the barrier itself.</p>

<p>The famous Victoria Falls of the Zambezi River
in South Africa, represents a relatively uncommon
type of waterfall. Considering height of the fall,
length of crest, and volume of water, this is perhaps
the greatest waterfall in the world. The Zambezi
River, a mile wide, plunges over 400 feet vertically
into a chasm only a few hundred feet wide and at
right angles to the main course of the stream. The
general country rock is hard lava, but locally a narrow
belt of the rock has been highly fractured vertically,
due to earth movements or faulting (see <a href="#earth_movements">explanation
beyond</a>) and therefore weakened and more
subject to weathering than the general body of the
lava rock. This belt of weakened rock has been
easy prey for erosion by the Zambezi River and the
chasm has there developed. In fact the chasm is
still being increased in depth. Leaving the chasm toward
one end, the river flows through a narrow zig-zag
gorge whose position has been determined by big
joint cracks. The mile-wide crest of the falls is interrupted
by a good many ledges and even small islands.
The thundering noise of this great waterfall
is most impressive, but a good complete view is impossible
because most of the chasm is constantly
filled with dense spray.</p>

<p>Still another type of waterfall develops by the removal
of joint blocks by the action of running water.
Falls of this type are fairly common though they
seldom attain really great heights. Where the rock
in the bed of a stream is traversed by well-developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">» 50 «</a></span>
vertical joint cracks, slabs of rock cleaved by the
joints may fall away due to weathering or they may
be pushed away by pressure of the water. Such a fall
retreats upstream by removal of joint blocks even in
comparatively homogeneous rocks. Taughannock
Falls, 215 feet high, in southern central New York,
has developed by this manner in a shaly sandstone.
The several falls (one 50 feet high) in the famous
gorge at Trenton Falls, in central New York, have
developed in this way in limestone.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></p>

<p class="caption3">THE SEA AND ITS WORK</p>

<div class="dropcap">I</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">I</span>T is well known that the waters of the sea cover
nearly three-fourths of the surface of the earth.
We think of the United States as being a large piece
of land of over three million square miles&mdash;but the
sea is about forty-five times as large, that is, it covers
approximately 140,000,000 square miles. It is a remarkable
fact that the average depth of the great
oceans of the earth is nearly two and one-half miles.
If the sea were universally present everywhere with
the same depth, it would be almost two miles deep.
Yet this vast body of water is an extremely thin
layer when compared with the earth&rsquo;s diameter of
8,000 miles. The Pacific is the deepest of the oceans
with an average depth of about two and three-fourths
miles. The deepest ocean water ever
sounded is 32,114 feet (over six miles), not far from
the Philippine Islands. This is known as the Planet
Deep, and was discovered in 1912. Second deepest
is 30,930 feet near the island of Guam. In the Pacific
Ocean there are five places where the water is over
five miles deep and eleven places were it is over
four miles deep. The deepest sounding ever made
in the Atlantic Ocean was 27,972 feet, not far from
Porto Rico.</p>

<p>Many substances are known to be in solution in
sea water, but in spite of this the composition is
remarkably uniform. The most abundant substance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">» 52 «</a></span>
by far in solution is common salt. In every 100
pounds of sea water, there are 3.5 pounds of mineral
matter of various kinds dissolved. Nearly 78 per
cent of the dissolved matter is common salt. The
principal other constituents in solution are chloride
and sulphate of magnesia, and the sulphates of lime
and potash. All other dissolved mineral substances
together make up less than one per cent of the total.
It has been estimated that if all the dissolved mineral
matter should be brought together, it would form a
layer 175 feet thick over the whole sea bottom. The
salts of the sea have been mostly supplied by the
rivers, which in turn have derived them from the
disintegration and chemical decay of the rocks.</p>

<p>If we make a general comparison with the surface
of the land, the floor of the ocean is a vast monotonous
plain. None of the sea bottom compares with the
ruggedness of mountains, and even the more level
portions of land surface show many sharp minor
irregularities such as stream trenches. But the sea
bottom is characterized by its smoothness of surface.
There are under the sea, however, mountain-like
ridges, plateaus, submarine volcanoes and valleys
known as &ldquo;deeps.&rdquo; But these rarely show
ruggedness of relief like similar features on land.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable relief features of the
ocean bottom is the so-called &ldquo;continental shelf.&rdquo;
This is a relatively narrow platform covered by shallow
water bordering nearly all the lands of the earth.
Seaward, the depth of water is greatest, and it is
seldom over 600 or 800 feet. The continental
shelves of the world cover about 10,000,000 square
miles or about one-fourteenth of the area of the sea.</p>

<p>Viewed in a broad way, there are two great classes
of marine deposits; first, those laid down comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">» 53 «</a></span>
near the borders of the land, that is, on the
continental shelf and continental slope, and second,
the abysmal deposits laid down on the bottom of the
deep ocean. Those found along and near the continental
borders are largely land-derived materials,
that is to say, they are mostly sediments carried
from the land into the sea by rivers, and to a lesser
extent rock material broken up by waves along many
shores. Practically all such land-derived material
is deposited within 100 to 300 miles of the shores.
The continental border deposits are extremely variable.
Near shore they are chiefly gravel and sands,
while farther out they become gradually finer, and
on the continental slope only very fine muds are deposited.
These deposits usually contain more or
less organic materials and shells or skeletons of
organisms. In some cases the shells or skeletons of
organisms predominate or even exist to the exclusion
of nearly all other material, as is true of the coral
deposits or reefs which form only in shallow water.
Deposits like those just described as accumulating
on the bottom of the shallow sea, comparatively near
the lands, are of great significance to the geologist
because just such marine deposits now consolidated
into sandstone, conglomerate, shale, and limestone,
are so widely exposed over the various continents.
A knowledge of the conditions under which shallow
sea deposits are now forming, is, therefore, of great
value in interpreting events of earth history as they
are recorded in similar rocks which have been
accumulating through millions of years of time.
One specific instance will make this matter clearer.
Using the method outlined in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a> for the determination
of earth chronology, and our knowledge of
present conditions under which shallow sea deposits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">» 54 «</a></span>
are formed, it has been well established that a shallow
sea spread over fully four-fifths of the area of
North America during the middle Ordovician period
of the early Paleozoic era. Beyond this main conclusion,
a careful study of these rocks has revealed
many important facts regarding the physical geography,
life, and climate of that time. The importance
of this whole matter is still further emphasized
by the statement that five-sixths of the exposed
rocks of the earth are strata&mdash;mostly of shallow sea
origin.</p>

<p>The deposits on the deep sea bottom are very
largely either organic or the shells and skeletons of
organisms which have fallen to the bottom from near
the surface as already explained. Most common of
these are the deep sea &ldquo;oozes&rdquo; which are made up of
the remains and shells of tiny organisms called
&ldquo;foraminifers.&rdquo; These &ldquo;oozes&rdquo; cover about 50 million
square miles of the sea bottom down to depths of
from two to three miles.</p>

<p>At depths greater than from two to three miles, a
peculiar red clay is the prevailing deposit. This is
most extensive of all, covering an area of 55 million
square miles, or nearly the total area of lands of the
earth. Some remains of organisms are mixed with
this clay, but since most of the shells are of carbonate
of lime and very thin, they are dissolved without
reaching the bottom in the deep sea water which is
under great pressure and rich in carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p>The deep sea deposits, both &ldquo;oozes&rdquo; and red clay,
do, however, contain some land-derived and other
materials. Thus off the west coast of Africa some
dust carried by the prevailing winds from the Sahara
Desert, is known to fall in the deep sea several hundred
miles from shore. Volcanic dust is carried for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">» 55 «</a></span>
many miles and deposited in the deep sea&mdash;particularly
in the South Pacific Ocean. Bits of porous
volcanic rock called &ldquo;pumice&rdquo; sometimes float long
distances out over the deep sea, before becoming
water soaked. Icebergs often drift far out from the
polar regions over the deep sea, and on melting the
rock débris which they carry is dropped to the sea
bottom. Also, particles of iron and dust from
meteorites (&ldquo;shooting stars&rdquo;) have been dredged
from the deep sea.</p>

<p>One important geological significance of the deep
sea deposits is the proof which they furnish that,
from at least as far back as the beginning of the
Paleozoic era, fully twenty-five million years ago,
to the present time, the two great deep ocean
basins&mdash;the Atlantic and the Pacific&mdash;have maintained
essentially the same positions on the earth.
This is proved by the fact that nowhere, on any continent
among the rocks of all ages, as old at least
as the early Paleozoic, do we find any really typical
deep-sea deposits. There is then no evidence that a
deep sea ever spread over any considerable part of
any continent, and this in spite of the fact that
marine deposits of shallow water origin furnish
abundant evidence of former sea extensions. The
shallow seas have at various times spread over large
portions of the continents.</p>

<p>On many rocky coasts the waves are incessantly
pounding and wearing away the rocks. In such
places the sea, like a mighty horizontal saw, is cutting
into the borders of the lands. The finer materials
produced by the grinding up of the rocks are carried
seaward by the undertow. But, if the land remains
stationary with reference to the sea, this landward
cutting by the waves reaches a limit. Since even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">» 56 «</a></span>
big waves have very little effect in water 100 or 200
feet deep, a shelf is cut by the waves and this shelf,
not many miles wide, is covered by shallow water.
The finer ground-up rock materials carried out by
the undertow are dumped just beyond the edge of
the shelf which is thus built out seaward as a terrace.
In traveling over this shelf and terrace, the waves,
due to friction, lose their power. With gradually
sinking land, a much wider shelf may be cut, because
the power of the waves is then allowed to continue.</p>

<p>It might be of interest to cite a few cases of relatively
rapid coast destruction by the waves which
have come under human observation. A remarkable
example is the island of Heligoland on which is (or
was) located the powerful German fort which guards
the entrance to the Kiel Canal. In the year 800 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>
this island had 120 miles of shore line; in 1300 it
had 45 miles of shore; in 1649 only 8 miles; and in
1900 but 3 miles of shore line remained. In southeastern
England &ldquo;whole farms and villages have
been washed away in the last few centuries, the sea
cliffs retreating from 7 to 15 feet a year.&rdquo; A church
located a mile from the sea shore near the mouth of
the Thames river, in the sixteenth century, now
stands on a cliff overlooking the sea. An island in
Chesapeake Bay covered over 400 acres in 1848, and
the waves have since reduced it to about fifty acres.
Study showed that the relatively soft unconsolidated
strata of the Nashaquitsa Cliffs on the island of
Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, were cut back at the rate of 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
feet per year, between 1846 and 1886.</p>

<p>If part of the relatively smooth sea bottom should
be raised into land, the resulting shore line would
of course, be regular and free from indentations or
sharp embayments. Examples of such coast which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">» 57 «</a></span>
are very young are at Cape Nome, Alaska; the northern
coast of Spain; and the west coast of northern
South America. Soon, however, such a shore line is
attacked, and, either where the waves are greatest
or the rocks are weakest, indentations will result
and the whole coast is gradually eaten back until the
power of the waves is largely spent in traveling
across the shallow water shelf. Sand bars are then
built across the mouths of the bays or indentations
which later the rivers gradually fill up with sediment.
The result is a relatively straight or regular
old shore line. The coast of Texas has about reached
this stage.</p>

<p>If a portion of the relatively rugged land surface
should become submerged under the sea, a very irregular,
deeply indented shore line would result, due
to the entrance of tidewater into the valleys. The
deeply indented coast of Maine is a fine example of a
very irregular youthful shore line produced by geologically
recent sinking of a rugged, hilly region so
that tidewater backs for miles into the lower reaches
of the river valleys. The promontories and islands
are undergoing rapid wear, and the development of
bars across the inlets has scarcely begun. Other excellent
examples are the coasts of Norway and southern
Alaska. Such a coast is then attacked by the
ocean waves and the promontories are cut back until
the broad shallow water shelf is formed, after which
sand bars are built across the remaining embayments
and the shore line becomes relatively regular.</p>

<p>It is, then, a remarkable fact that, whether shore
lines originate by emergence of sea bottom, or by
sinking of land, there is a very strong tendency on
the part of nature to develop regular shore lines. It
should be stated that the principles of wave work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">» 58 «</a></span>
and shore-form development just outlined apply almost
equally well to lakes, especially large ones.</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject of shore-line development,
mention should be made of the fact that bars
and beaches are often built part way or wholly across
embayments of the coast with surprising rapidity.
To illustrate, Sandy Hook, New Jersey, is advancing
northward, while Rockaway Beach, New York,
is extending westward, the tendency being to close
up the entrance to New York harbor and to make
the line of seashore more nearly regular. Records
show that Rockaway Beach actually advanced westward
more than three miles between the years 1835
and 1908.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></p>

<p class="caption3">GLACIERS AND THEIR WORK</p>

<div class="dropcap">A</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">A</span> GLACIER may be defined as a mass of flowing
ice. The motion may not be that of flowage in
the usually accepted sense of the term. A discussion
of the various theories of glacier motion will
not here be attempted. Glaciers form only in regions
of perpetual snow, but they commonly move down
far below the line of perpetual snow of any given
region. In the polar regions they may form near
sea level, while in the tropics they form at altitudes
of two to three miles, and there only rarely. In
southern Alaska, the lower limit of perpetual snow
is about 5,000 feet above sea level, and many of the
glaciers come down to sea (<a href="#Plate_4a">Plate 4</a>), while in the
Alps, the lower limit of perpetual snow is at about
9,000 feet, and the glaciers descend as much as 5,000
feet below it.</p>

<p>In regions of perpetual snow there is a tendency
for more or less snow to accumulate faster than it
can be removed by evaporation or melting. As such
snow accumulates it gradually undergoes a change,
especially in its lower parts, first into granulated
snow (so-called &ldquo;névé&rdquo;) and then into solid ice.
Snow drifts in the northern United States often
undergo similar transformation, after a few months
first to névé, and then to ice. This transformation
seems to be brought about mainly by weight of overlying
snow which compacts the snow crystals; by
rain or melting snow percolating into the snow to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">» 60 «</a></span>
freeze and fill spaces between the snow crystals; and
by the actual growth of the crystals themselves.
When ice of sufficient thickness has accumulated
(probably at best several hundred feet), the spreading
action or flowage begins and a glacier has developed.
Renewed snowfalls over the gathering
ground keep up the supply of ice.</p>

<p>There are several types of glaciers: valley or alpine
glaciers; cliff or hanging glaciers; piedmont
glaciers; ice caps; and continental ice sheets. A
valley or alpine glacier consists essentially of a
stream of ice slowly flowing down a valley and fed
from a catchment basin of snow within a region of
perpetual snow. In the Alps, where glaciers of this
sort are very typically shown, they vary in length
up to eight or nine miles. Perhaps the grandest display
of great valley glaciers is in southern Alaska
where they attain lengths up to forty or fifty miles
and widths of one or two miles (<a href="#Plate_4a">Plate 4</a>).</p>

<p>Hanging or cliff glaciers are in many ways like
valley glaciers, but they are generally smaller; they
develop in snow-filled basins above the snow line
usually on steep mountain sides; and they do not
reach down into well-defined valleys. Most of the
glaciers of the Glacier National Park in Montana
and many of those in the Cascade Mountains are of
this type. Mount Rainier in Washington is one of
the most remarkable single large mountain peaks in
the world, in regard to development of glaciers over
it. Great tongues of ice, starting mostly at 8,000 to
10,000 feet above sea level, flow down the sides of the
mountain for distances of to four and even six miles.
The total area of ice in this remarkable system of
radiating glaciers on this one mountain is over forty
square miles. These Mount Rainier glaciers are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">» 61 «</a></span>
general best classified as intermediate in type between
valley and hanging glaciers.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 469px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Map of Mount Rainier, Washington, showing its wonderful
system of glaciers which covers more than 40 square miles. Dotted
portions represent moraines. (U. S. Geological Survey.)</div>
</div>

<p>In some high latitude areas, as in Iceland and
Spitzbergen, snow and ice may accumulate on
relatively level plains or plateaus and slowly spread
or flow radially from their centers. These are called
ice caps. Ordinary ice caps usually do not cover
more than some hundreds of square miles.</p>

<p>Continental glaciers or ice sheets are, in principle,
much like ice caps, but they are larger. Greenland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">» 62 «</a></span>
is buried under an ice sheet of moderate size (about
500,000 square miles), the motion being outward in
all directions toward the sea. Tongues of ice, like
valley glaciers, are commonly sent off from the main
body of ice across the land border of Greenland into
the sea. The size of the great ice sheet of Antarctica
is not definitely known, but it covers probably
at least several million square miles. Two continental
ice sheets of special interest to the geologist are
those which existed during the great Ice Age of the
Quaternary period. One of these then covered
nearly 4,000,000 square miles of North
America, while the other covered about 600,000
square miles of northern Europe. The main facts
regarding the Ice Age are given in a succeeding
chapter. The facts brought out in the present discussion
of existing glaciers will greatly aid in understanding
the Ice Age.</p>

<p>How fast do glaciers flow? Based upon many observations,
we may say that an average rate of flow
for the glaciers of the world is not more than a few
feet per day. A very exceptional case is a large
glacier, branching off as a tongue from the ice sheet
of Greenland, which is said to move sixty to seventy-five
feet per day. Some of the great Alaskan glaciers
have been found to flow from four to forty feet per
day. Most glaciers of the Alps move only one to two
feet per day. A glacier advances only when the rate
of motion is greater than the rate of melting of its
lower end and vice versa in the case of retreat. Thus
it is true, though seemingly paradoxical, to assert
that a glacier has a constant forward motion even
when it is retreating by melting.</p>

<p>By watching the changing position of marked objects
placed in the ice, it has been proved that, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">» 63 «</a></span>
valley glacier, the top moves faster than the bottom;
the middle moves faster than the sides; the rate of
motion increases with thickness of ice, slope of floor
over which it moves, and temperature.</p>

<p>Ice, like molasses candy, tends to crack when subjected
to a relatively sudden force, and where the ice
rides over a salient on the bed of the glacier, transverse
cracks or fissures often develop. Due to more
rapid motion of the central part of a valley glacier,
stresses and strains are set up and crevasses are
formed, usually pointing obliquely upstream. Where
the ice tends to spread laterally in a broad portion
of a valley, longitudinal cracks may develop. Crevasses
vary in size up to several feet in width and
hundreds of feet in depth. Owing to the forward
motion of the ice, old fissures tend to close up and
new ones form, and, aided by uneven melting, the
surface of a glacier is generally very rough.</p>

<p>Like running water, ice may have considerable
erosive power when it is properly supplied with tools.
The total erosive effect which has been, and is now
being, accomplished by ice compared with that of
running water is, however, slight. One of the main
processes by which ice erosion is accomplished is
&ldquo;corrasion&rdquo; due to the rubbing or grinding action
of hard rock fragments frozen into the bottom and
sides of the glacier. Thick ice, shod with hard rock
fragments and flowing through a deep, narrow valley
of soft rock, is especially powerful as an erosive
agent because the abrasive tools are supplied; the
work to be done is easy; and the deep ice causes
great pressure on the bottom and lower sides of the
valley. Rock surfaces which have been thus subjected
to ice erosion are characteristically smoothed
and more or less scratched, striated, or ground due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">» 64 «</a></span>
to the corrosive effects of small and large rock fragments.
This affords one of the best means of proving
the former presence of a glacier over a region or
in a valley. A typical V-shaped stream cut (eroded)
valley is changed into one with a U-shaped profile
or cross section by glacier erosion (<a href="#Plate_5">Plate 5</a>).</p>

<p>Another important process of ice erosion is &ldquo;plucking,&rdquo;
which consists in pushing among already more
or less loosened joint blocks by the pressure of the
moving ice. The pressure thus exerted, especially by
a deep valley glacier, may be enormous. This process
was an important factor in the development of the
famous Yosemite Valley, a very brief account of
whose history it will now be instructive to give.</p>

<p>The Yosemite Valley, about 7 miles long, less than
one mile wide, and from 2,000 to 4,000 feet deep, lies
on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains
of California. Great cliffs of granite, mostly from
1,000 to over 3,000 feet high, bound the valley on
either side. The floor of the valley is wide and remarkably
flat (<a href="#Plate_6">Plate 6</a>). Just prior to the Ice Age,
by the processes of erosion already set forth, the
Merced River had carved out a great steep-sided V-shaped
canyon commonly from 1,000 to 3,000 feet
deep. During the Ice Age, two glaciers joined to
form an extra deep powerful glacier, which flowed
through a deep part of the Merced Canyon and modified
it into the Yosemite Valley, essentially as we see
it to-day. Because the ice was shod with many fragments
of hard rock (granite), and the pressure at
the bottom and lower sides of the glacier (several
thousand feet thick) was so great, the V-shaped
stream-cut canyon was changed to a U-shaped canyon
with very steep to even vertical walls. A factor
of great importance which notably aided the erosive
power of the glacier in this case was the existence
of an unusual number of large vertical joint cracks
in the granite in this local region. The plucking action
of the ice was thus very greatly facilitated and
great slabs of rock, separated by the vertical joints,
especially toward the lower sides and bottom of the
valley, were pushed away one after another by the
ice. When the ice disappeared, great precipitous
joint faces from 1,000 to 3,000 feet high were left
along the valley sides. At its lower end the glacier
left a dam of glacial débris (moraine) across the
valley, thus causing a lake to form over the valley
floor. The wide flat bottom of the valley was caused
by filling up of the lake with sediment. The uniqueness
of the Yosemite Valley is, then, due to a remarkable
combination of several main factors; one,
the presence of a large swift river well supplied with
tools which carved out a deep V-shaped canyon; two,
a mighty glacier which plowed its way through this
canyon and converted it by erosion into a U-shaped
canyon; three, the weakening of the rock by
many joint cracks, thus greatly facilitating the ice
erosion; and four, a postglacial lake covering the
valley floor which became filled with sediment. As a
result of the ice work, several streams, tributary to
the main stream (Merced River) which flows through
the bottom of the valley, were forced to plunge over
great vertical rock walls (joint faces), thus producing
high and beautiful true waterfalls, including the
very high Upper Yosemite Fall where Yosemite
Creek makes a straight drop of 1,430 feet. A tributary
valley like that of Yosemite Creek, which ends
abruptly well above the main valley, is known as a
&ldquo;hanging&rdquo; valley. The valley of Bridal Veil Creek
is another good example. (See <a href="#Plate_6">Plate 6.</a>) Valleys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">» 66 «</a></span>
which were once occupied by active glaciers are generally
characterized by their U-shaped cross sections
and their hanging (tributary) valleys, but the great
height and steepness of the valley walls in Yosemite
are exceptional.</p>

<p>A type of glacial erosion which is of special interest
is the sculpturing of so-called &ldquo;cirques&rdquo; or
&ldquo;amphitheaters&rdquo; in mountains within the region of
perpetual snow. Where the main mass of snow and
ice in the catchment basin or gathering ground of
a valley glacier pulls away from the snow and névé
on the upper slopes, the rock wall is more or less exposed
in the deep crevasse. During warm days
water fills the joint cracks in the rocks down in
this crevasse (so-called &ldquo;Bergschrund&rdquo;), and during
cold nights the water freezes and forces the blocks
of rock apart. This is greatest toward the bottom
of the crevasse and so, by this excavating or quarrying
process, vertical or very steep walls are developed
around a great bowlike basin or cirque.
Such cirques, now free from glacial ice, with precipitous
walls 500 to 2,000 feet high and one-fourth
of a mile to one-half of a mile across, are common
in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges and in
the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>What becomes of the materials eroded by the ice?
An answer to this question involves at least a brief
discussion of the deposition of glacial débris, this
constituting an important feature of the work of ice.
The débris transported by a glacier is carried either
on its surface or within it, or pushed along under it.
It is generally heterogeneous material ranging from
the finest clay through sand and gravel, to bowlders
of many tons' weight. Various types of glacial deposits
are abundantly illustrated by débris left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">» 67 «</a></span>
strewn over much of the northeastern United States
and some reference to these will be made.</p>

<p>Most valley glaciers carry considerable débris on
their surfaces, this representing material which falls
or is carried down from the valley walls upon the
margins of the ice, thus forming marginal moraines.
When two glaciers flow together, one marginal
moraine from each will coalesce to form a medial
moraine. The material carried along at the bottom
of a glacier is called the ground moraine. Where it
contains much very fine grained material with pebbles
or bowlders scattered through its mass, it is
called &ldquo;till&rdquo; or &ldquo;bowlder clay.&rdquo; The pebbles or bowlders
of the ground moraine are commonly facetted
and striated as a result of having been rubbed
against the bedrock on which the glacier moved.
Ground moraine material is the most extensively
developed of all glacial deposits. It is so widely
scattered over the glaciated northeastern portion of
the United States that most of the soils consist of
it, having been left strewn over the country during
the melting of the vast ice sheet.</p>

<p>When a glacier remains practically stationary for
some time, more or less material which it carries
is piled up at its lower end to form a terminal
moraine. Repeated pauses during general glacier
retreat permit the accumulations of so-called recessional
moraines. A wonderful display of recessional
moraines occurs from the Great Lakes south, where
they are festooned one within another and remain
almost exactly as they were formed during pauses
in retreat of great lobes of ice during the closing
stages of the Ice Age. A great terminal moraine
marks the southernmost limit of the ice sheet during
the Ice Age, a very fine illustration being the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">» 68 «</a></span>
ridge of low irregular hills extending the whole
length of Long Island. Some of the material in that
morainic ridge was transported by the ice from
northern New England.</p>

<p>Considerable rock débris is transported within the
ice, and such &ldquo;englacial&rdquo; material in part results
from rock débris which falls on the surface in the
catchment basin and becomes buried under new
snowfalls which change to ice, and in part from
material which falls into the crevasses in the glacier
farther down the valley. Marked objects thrown
into the catchment basin have, after many years,
emerged at or near the end of the glacier; thus the
rate of motion can be very accurately told. A very
remarkable case of transportation through the body
of a glacier is the following: In 1820, three men
were buried under an avalanche in the catchment
basin of the Bossons Glacier in the Alps. Forty-one
years later several parts of the bodies, including the
three heads together with some pieces of clothing,
emerged at the foot of the glacier after traveling
most of its length at the rate of eight inches per day.
The heads were so perfectly preserved after their
remarkable journey in cold storage that they were
clearly recognized by former friends!</p>

<p>Where a valley floor slopes downward away from
the end of a glacier, waters emerging from the ice,
heavily loaded with rock débris, cause more or less
deposition of the débris on the valley floor often for
miles beyond the ice front. Such a deposit is called
a &ldquo;valley train.&rdquo; When the ice front pauses for a
considerable time upon a rather flat surface, the
débris-laden waters emerging from the ice develop
an &ldquo;outwash plain&rdquo; by deposition of sediment rather
uniformly over the flat surface. A very fine example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">» 69 «</a></span>
is the plain which constitutes most of the southern
half of Long Island just beyond the southern limit
of the great terminal moraine ridge.</p>

<p>A type of glacial deposit of particular interest is
the &ldquo;drumlin&rdquo; which is, in reality, only a special form
of ground moraine material (commonly till), and,
therefore, essentially unstratified. Typical drumlins
are low, rounded mounds of till with roughly elliptical
bases and steeper fronts facing the direction
from which the ice flowed. Their long axes are always
parallel to the direction of ice movement. In
height they commonly range from 50 to 200 feet.
Their mode of origin is not yet definitely known, but
they form near the margins of broad lobes of ice
either by erosion of earlier glacial deposits, or
by accumulation beneath the ice under peculiarly
favorable conditions, as perhaps in the longitudinal
crevasses. One of the finest and most extensive
exhibitions of drumlins in the world is in western
New York between Syracuse and Rochester. Thousands
of drumlins there rise above the general level
of the Ontario plain, the New York Central Railroad
passing through the very midst of them. Drumlins
are also abundant in eastern Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Another type of glacial deposit in the form of low
hills is the &ldquo;kame&rdquo; which, unlike the drumlin, always
consists of more or less stratified material.
Kames are seldom over 200 feet high, and they are of
various shapes. In many cases they form irregular
groups of hills, and in other cases fairly well defined
kame ridges. Kames form as deposits from débris-laden
streams emerging from the margins of
glaciers, the water sometimes rising as great fountains
because of the pressure. Such deposits are now
actually in process of formation along the edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">» 70 «</a></span>
the great Malaspina Glacier of Alaska. Kames are
commonly associated with terminal and recessional
moraines. &ldquo;Eskers&rdquo; are similar except that they are
long winding low ridges of stratified material deposited
by débris-laden streams, probably in longitudinal
fissures in the ice near its margin. (See
<a href="#Plate_20a">Plate 20.</a>)</p>

<p>Glacial bowlders, or &ldquo;erratics&rdquo; are blocks of rock
or bowlders left strewn over the country during the
melting of the ice. They vary in size from small
pebbles to those of many tons of weight, and most
of them were derived from ledges of relatively hard,
resistant rocks. (See <a href="#Plate_20a">Plate 20.</a>) Erratics have very
commonly been carried a few miles from their parent
ledges, while more rarely they have traveled even
hundreds of miles. They are extremely abundant in
New York and New England, many occurring even
high up on the mountains. In some cases erratics
of ten or more tons' weight have been left in such
remarkably balanced positions on bedrock that a
child can cause one of them to swing back and forth
slightly. Such a bowlder is literally a &ldquo;rocking
stone.&rdquo; In the Adirondack Mountains the writer
recently observed a rounded erratic of very hard
rock fourteen feet in diameter resting in a very remarkably
balanced position on top of another large
round glacial bowlder.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE ACTION OF WIND</p>

<div class="dropcap">O</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">O</span>NLY during the last quarter of a century have
geologists come to properly appreciate the really
important geological work of the wind. One reason
for this is the fact that people live mostly in humid
regions where the soils are largely effectually protected
against wind action by the vegetation. But
even in such regions, wind action is by no means
negligible. One has but to observe the great clouds
of dust raised by strong wind from freshly cultivated
fields during a little dry weather in the late spring.
Much of this dust is carried considerable distances,
often miles, and in some cases young crops are injured
by removal of soil from around the roots, while
in other cases young plants are buried by deposition
of the wind-blown material over them. In humid
regions, the action of the wind is perhaps most
strikingly exhibited along and near shores of sea
and lakes, where loose dry sands are picked up and
transported in great quantities, often depositing
them as sand dunes, which may form groups of hills
covering considerable areas. Very conspicuous examples
are the sand dunes of Dune Park in northern
Indiana, and the dunes along the coast of New
Jersey.</p>

<p>But the action of wind is most strikingly effective
in desert and semiarid regions. The importance of
the work of wind is made more impressive when we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">» 72 «</a></span>
realize that about one-fifth of the land of the earth
is desert.</p>

<p>In deserts some of the ordinary agents of weathering
and erosion are either absent or notably reduced
in effectiveness. Thus, stream action is, in general,
reduced to a minimum; weathering effects due to
moisture in the air are notably reduced, and either
frost action, or wedge work of ice, is relatively unimportant
due to lack of water. Change of temperature
between night and day is, however, unusually
important as a process whereby rocks are broken
up due to relatively rapid expansion and contraction
in deserts because such temperature changes
are exceptionally great, and rocks and soils are
almost everywhere directly exposed, being free
from vegetation.</p>

<p>The finer grained materials, especially sand grains,
in deserts are picked up by the wind and driven,
often with great velocity, against barren rock ledges
and large and small rock fragments. By this process
(corrasion) the rocks are worn and often polished
by the materials blown against them. The principle
is that of the artificial sand-blast, used in etching
glass, or cleaning and polishing building and decorative
stones. Under favorable conditions wind-driven
sand accomplishes noticeable erosion in a surprisingly
short time. Thus, in a hard wind storm, a plate
glass window in a lighthouse on Cape Cod was worn
to opaqueness, while in a few weeks or months the
directly exposed window glass may there be worn
through.</p>

<p>The great erosive effect of wind-driven sand is
relatively close to the ground because the larger and
heavier fragments are not lifted to very considerable
heights. For this reason ordinary telegraph poles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">» 73 «</a></span>
are difficult to maintain in desert regions because,
unless they are specially protected, they are soon
cut down by sand swept against their bases. In the
desert regions of our Southwestern States cliffs rising
above the general level of the country are often
undercut by wind erosion, sometimes with the development
of large caverns. (See <a href="#Plate_1a">Plate 1.</a>) Even
the high portions of great ledges are there more or
less fantastically sculptured by wind erosion, the
softer portions being more deeply cut into than the
harder. The famous sphinx of Egypt has been
notably roughened by action of this kind.</p>

<p>The enormous power of high winds to transport
rock material in desert regions is strikingly illustrated
by the great sand storms of the Sahara Desert,
where sand and dust, forming clouds with cubic
miles of volume, sweep for many miles across the
country. Some one has estimated that every cubic
mile of air in such a storm contains more than 100,000
tons of rock material. It is said that an army
of 50,000 men under Cambyses was buried under
the sands of a storm in the desert of northern
Africa.</p>

<p>Dust from some of these storms is known to be
driven hundreds of miles out over the Atlantic Ocean,
there to settle in the sea. In mountainous desert
regions, like the Great Basin of our Western States,
the general tendency is for the rock materials wind-eroded
from the mountains to be carried into the intermontane
basins or valleys. Some basins of this
sort are believed to contain depths of 1,000 to 2,000
feet of wind-blown material.</p>

<p>A special kind of wind-blown material called
&ldquo;loess,&rdquo; is a sort of fine-grained yellow, or brown
loam which, though relatively unconsolidated, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">» 74 «</a></span>
a remarkable property of standing out as high steep
cliffs or bluffs along the banks of streams. Many
thousands of square miles of northern China are
covered with loess. Among many other regions,
thousands of square miles of parts of the States of
Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas are covered with loess,
which, in this case, is believed to be fine material
gathered by winds from the region just after the retreat
of one of the ice sheets of the great Ice Age,
when there was very little vegetation to hold down
the loose soils of glacial origin.</p>

<p>Much as snowdrifts are formed, so, in many
places, the wind-driven sands are built up into
sand hills or so-called &ldquo;dunes.&rdquo; Dunes are very common
in many places, as for example, along our middle
Atlantic coast; in Dune Park of northern Indiana;
and in the great arid and semiarid regions of the
Western States. Where there is a distinctly prevailing
direction of wind, the sand is blown to the leeward
side from the windward side, and the dunes are
caused to migrate in the direction of the wind. The
burial and destruction of forests, and the uncovering
of the dead trees is not uncommonly caused by migration
of sand dunes, all stages of this phenomenon being
well exhibited in Dune Park, Indiana. The rate
of dune migration is very variable, but study in a
number of places has shown a rate of from a few feet
to more than 100 feet per year. Arable lands, buildings,
and even towns have been encroached upon
and buried under drifting sand. An interesting example
is a church in the village of Kunzen, on the
Baltic seashore which, in a period of sixty years,
became completely buried under a dune and then
completely uncovered by migration of the dune.
Much destruction has been wrought by shifting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">» 75 «</a></span>
sands on the Bay of Biscay, where farms and even
villages have been overwhelmed. The ruins of the
ancient cities of Babylon and Nineveh are buried
mostly under wind-blown sand and dust. There is
good reason to believe that the climate of central and
western Asia is now notably drier than it was a few
thousand years ago, and this may help to explain
the burial of many old cities and villages there
under wind-blown deposits.</p>

<p class="caption3">INSTABILITY OF THE EARTH&rsquo;S CRUST</p>

<div class="dropcap">T</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">T</span>HE crust of the earth is unstable. To the
modern student of geology the old notion of a
&ldquo;terra firma&rdquo; is outworn. The idea of an unshakable,
immovable earth could never have emanated
from the inhabitants of an earthquake country. In
general we may recognize two types of crustal movements&mdash;slow
and sudden. To most people the sudden
movements accompanied by earthquakes are
more significant and impressive because they are
more localized and evident, and often accompanied
by destruction of property, or quick, though minor,
changes in the landscape. But movements which
take place slowly and quietly are often of far
greater significance in the interpretation of the profound
physical changes which have affected the
earth during its millions of years of known history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">» 77 «</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Structure section across the Hudson River Valley near West
Point, New York. The shafts and tunnel, 1,200 feet below sea level,

the Catskills. The Preglacial valley has been submerged and filled
with Postglacial sediment to a depth of nearly 800 feet. (Redrawn
by the author after Berkey, from New York State Museum Bulletin.)</div>
</div>

<p>A few well-known examples will serve to prove
that upward, downward, and differential movements
of the earth&rsquo;s crust have actually taken place not
only in the remote ages of geologic time, but also
that such movements have geologically recently
taken place, and that similar movements are still
going on. It is very important that the reader
thoroughly appreciate the fact that crustal disturbances,
often profound ones, do take place, because
this is one of the most fundamental tenets of geologic
science. Let us consider the case of the Hudson-Champlain-St.
Lawrence Valley region. That
the whole region was once notably higher (at least
1,000 feet) than at present is proved by the drowned
character of the Hudson Valley, in which tidewater
extends northward for 150 miles to near Troy.
Where the New York City Aqueduct passes under the
Hudson River near Newburgh, the bedrock bottom
of the old river channel is now about 800 feet below
sea level as determined by drilling. This old channel
is there filled up nearly to sea level with glacial
and postglacial rock débris, which shows that the
old channel must have been cut before the oncoming
of the ice of the great Ice Age. Before the Ice
Age, then, the lower Hudson Valley must have been
considerably more than 800 feet higher than at
present, because it then contained a river with sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">» 78 «</a></span>
current to be an active agent of erosion,
carving out the canyonlike valley in the vicinity of
West Point. This conclusion is strongly reenforced
by the fact that the old valley of the Hudson River
has been definitely traced as a distinct trench across
the shallow sea bottom for about 100 miles eastward
from the entrance to New York harbor. Toward
the eastern end of this trench the depth of water is
now considerably over 1,000 feet, and thus it is
obvious that, preceding the Ice Age, the earth&rsquo;s
crust in the vicinity of New York City must have
been much higher than at present, so that the Hudson
River was able to erode its now completely
drowned channel. Somewhat similar evidence has
also established the fact that the lower St. Lawrence
Valley region was much higher before the
Ice Age. It is evident, therefore, that the general
Hudson-St. Lawrence Valley region is now notably
lower with reference to sea level than it was before
the Ice Age. That this was caused by actual sinking
of the earth&rsquo;s crust rather than by a rise of
sea level is proved by the fact that similar changes
of level between land and sea did not take place at
the same time even along the Atlantic and Gulf
coast of our Southern States.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to the next step in the geologically
recent history of earth-crust movements
in the Hudson-Champlain-St. Lawrence Valley
region by asserting that, since the Ice Age, the land
was actually notably lower than at present. In fact,
the land was enough lower to allow tidewater to
extend up the St. Lawrence Valley into the Ontario
basin, and all through the Champlain-Hudson Valley.
Many beaches, bars, and delta deposits formed
in these arms of the sea are still plainly preserved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">» 79 «</a></span>
in some cases with shells and bones of marine animals
in them, now hundreds of feet above sea level.
These marine deposits are highest above sea level
in the northern portion of the Champlain Valley,
where they lie at an altitude of 700 feet or more and
their altitude steadily diminishes southward to about
300 to 400 feet in the general vicinity of Albany, and
to near sea level in the general vicinity of New York
City. Obviously, then, the land stood lower during
part or all of the interval of not more than a few
tens of thousands of years since the Ice Age than
at present. This leads us to the third important
conclusion regarding earth movements in this
region, namely, that still later the land has undergone
a differential uplift, the rate having steadily
increased toward the north where the total uplift
is many hundreds of feet. We have discussed this
region somewhat in detail because the principles of
slow up and down movements of the earth&rsquo;s crust
are there so plainly recorded.</p>

<p>Among many other regions where earth movements
similar to those above described have taken
place, brief mention may be made of Norway. The
great fjords of Norway were, just before the Ice
Age, stream-cut valleys which were then more or
less modified by glacial erosion, and after the Ice
Age the rivers in them were drowned due to land
subsidence. The kind of evidence is like that above
given for the lower Hudson River. Since the subsidence
there has been partial reelevation, as proved
by the fact that along the sides of the larger fjords
marine terraces and beaches may be traced with
gradually increasing altitude for many miles (150
or more) back into the country where they are hundreds
of feet above tidewater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">» 80 «</a></span></p>

<p>Scandinavia is of still further special interest because
very appreciable earth movements have there
come under human observation. Marks carefully
placed along the shores of Sweden by the government
have proved that during the last 150 years
the southern end of the country has actually subsided
several feet, while from Stockholm north the
land has risen in increasing amount, reaching a maximum
of seven or eight feet. In southern Sweden, at
Malmo, a certain street now at times becomes covered
by wind-driven high water, and during excavations
made some years ago an older street eight feet
below the present one was found.</p>

<p>A theory which appears to be in perfect harmony
with the facts to account for the subsidence and partial
reelevation of central eastern North America
and Scandinavia since the beginning of the Ice Age
is that the great weight of ice during the Ice Age
pressed the land down, and that since the removal
of the ice there has been an appreciable tendency
for the land to spring back.</p>

<p>Certain crustal movements which have occurred
about the Bay of Naples are of very special interest
because actual human history dates can be placed
upon them. Most remarkable are the records in
connection with the temple of Jupiter Serapis
which was built near the shore before the Christian
era. The land sank about five feet and a new pavement
had to be constructed; then, by the middle of
the third century A. D., the temple rose to well above
sea level. By about the ninth century the land had
subsided fully thirty feet, so that marble columns of
the temple were bored full of holes as high as twenty-one
feet above their bases by marine-shelled animals,
species of which still live in the bay. Then a slow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">» 81 «</a></span>
uplift of twenty-three feet began, bringing the bases
of the columns two feet above sea level by 1749. Since
that time a slight sinking has taken place and this
seems to be still going on. Three of the marble columns
with the borings still stand in upright position.</p>

<p>While the movements just described were taking
place, the island of Capri, twenty miles across the
Bay of Naples, has slowly sunk to an amount estimated
at thirty or forty feet as proved by evidence
from the famous Blue Grotto. About the beginning
of the Christian era a large ancient wave-cut cave,
part of which is now called the Blue Grotto, had its
floor above sea level, and it was used by certain Romans
as a cool place to retire to from the heat. In
order to obtain better light an opening was cut
through its upper portion. The land has sunk so
much that at the present time even part of the artificial
opening (through which tourists pass) is now
under water.</p>

<p>By way of illustrating remarkable contrasts in
direction of crustal movements on very considerable
scales in a given region, we shall briefly mention some
facts regarding part of the coast of southern California
and the neighboring islands of Santa Catalina
and San Clemente, respectively twenty-five and fifty
miles offshore. Those movements were not, however,
checked up by human history records. The
mainland at San Pedro has clearly risen 1,240 feet,
as proved by the presence of unusually perfect coast
terraces (so-called &ldquo;raised beaches&rdquo;), while San
Clemente has risen 1,500 feet as proved by the
raised beaches into which deep, youthful V-shaped
stream-cut valleys have been sunk, and a shore line
characteristic of recent notable uplift. It is a remarkable
fact that at the same time the intervening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">» 82 «</a></span>
island (Santa Catalina) has notably sunk, as
proved by the nature of its shore line, and the distinctly
more mature character of its topography.</p>

<p>We are, however, by no means dependent upon
lands along sea shores for evidences of slow rising
and sinking of land. Thus, by careful measurements
it has been shown that the general region of
the Great Lakes is now differentially rising toward
the northeast at the rate of about five inches per 100
miles per century. At Chicago the rise of water is
estimated at about nine inches per century, which
means increase of flowage through the Chicago
Canal. At this rate the upper lakes would, in some
thousands of years, drain through this canal to
the Mississippi. A well-preserved shore line of the
large ancestor of Lake Ontario shows a steady
increase in altitude at the rate of several feet per
mile toward the northeast from near Niagara to
the St. Lawrence Valley, thus proving a tilting of
the land since the shore line was formed.</p>

<p>Shore lines of the great ancestor of Great Salt
Lake also show warping of the earth&rsquo;s crust, some
parts of a definite shore line being several hundred
feet higher than others.</p>

<p>Very significant evidence pointing to profound
crustal movements consist in the finding of fossil
remains of marine animals in the strata high above
sea level, very commonly from one to three miles, in
many parts of the world, especially in the high mountains.
In Wyoming, nearly horizontal strata of the
Mesozoic Age carrying marine fossils lie two miles
or more above sea level. The fact that given formations,
carrying marine fossils representing certain
definite portions of geologic time, are found at various
altitudes up to several miles in many parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">» 83 «</a></span>
world, shows that the land in those places has really
risen relative to sea level.</p>

<p>It should not be presumed from the above discussion
that the sea level itself has never changed.
Thus, the vast areas of thick ice sheets in both
North America and Europe during the Great Ice
Age represented sufficient water withdrawn from
the sea to very appreciably lower its level. All land-derived
materials, carried into the sea mainly by
rivers, displace sea water, with consequent rise of
its level. If all existing lands were worn down and
carried into the sea, its level would be raised some
hundreds of feet. Subsidence of any part of the
ocean bottom would cause a lowering of sea level.
There is a strong reason to believe that some such
shiftings of sea level have occurred during the vast
lapse of geologic time. During certain periods
erosion of the land predominated, and during other
periods building up of the land predominated, as
pointed out in the chapters on geologic history. It
is not thought that shifting of sea level has ever
amounted to more than a few hundred feet, at least
not during the millions of years of the more clearly
recorded earth history.</p>

<p>We have thus far considered slow upward and
downward movements of the earth&rsquo;s crust without
notable structural changes in the rocks. Another
type of crustal disturbance causes more or less profound
changes in the structures of the rocks themselves.
Just how the earth originated is a matter
of uncertainty, but we can be sure that for many
millions of years it has been a shrinking body. The
outer, or crustal, portion of the earth, in adjusting
itself to the contracting interior, has had many
pressures, stresses, and strains set up within it. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">» 84 «</a></span>
results of such forces the rocks at and near the
earth&rsquo;s surface have in various places, and at
various times, been broken (faulted) and subjected
to sudden movements (see <a href="#earth_movements">discussion beyond</a>), while
those well within the crustal portion, that is to say
a few miles or more down, have, in many cases,
been bent (folded), or even crumpled. For these
reasons the surface and near-surface crustal portions
are called the &ldquo;zone of fracture,&rdquo; while the
more deeply buried portions comprise the &ldquo;zone of
flowage.&rdquo; In the zone of flowage the rocks, where
subjected to great lateral pressure, act like plastic
materials and therefore bend rather than break, because
of the great weight of overlying materials.
Laboratory experiments have confirmed the findings
of geologists in this regard. Small masses of rocks
properly inclosed in nickel-steel cylinders have been
subjected to slow differential pressures equivalent
to those which obtain twenty to forty miles within
the earth. Under such conditions rocks have been
made to change shape very notably without fracturing.
Both geological observations and experiments
have led us to conclude that not even small fractures
or crevices can remain open at a depth greater than
ten or twelve miles even in the hardest rocks.</p>

<p>From time to time, during the long history of
the earth, forces of lateral pressure have been
slowly exerted along more or less localized zones or
belts within the earth&rsquo;s crust, and the rocks have
been deformed chiefly by bending or folding, especially
in those regions where mountains of the
folded type have developed. Movements of this type
are considered beyond in the chapter on mountains.
Rock folds vary in size from microscopic to miles
across, and they exhibit many shapes. <a href="#Plate_7">Plate 7</a> will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">» 85 «</a></span>
give the reader a good idea of actual rock folds of
common sizes and shapes in various places. Folded
structures are most clearly discernible in sedimentary
rocks, because of their stratified (layered)
arrangement. Since folds in hard rocks rarely, if
ever, develop except at a depth of some miles within
the earth, they show at the surface only where
great thicknesses of overlying materials have been
stripped off by erosion.</p>

the great mountain-making disturbance at the end of the Ordovician
period fully 20,000,000 years ago. (After Dale, U. S. Geological
Survey.)</div>
</div>

<p>From the standpoint of our consideration of slow
earth-crust movements, it is important to bear in
mind that lateral pressure in the zone of flowage
has not only notably deformed rocks, but that, as
a result of the buckling forces, given rock masses
have, in many cases, been notably shifted downward
or upward&mdash;mainly upward&mdash;from their original
positions. Folded strata carrying shells of sea
animals are commonly found thousands of feet
above sea level in many of the great mountain
ranges of the world. During the process of folding
on a large scale the crust of the earth is very
appreciably shortened at right angles to the direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">» 86 «</a></span>
of applied pressure, due to squeezing or bending
of the strata. In the case of the Appalachian mountains
of Pennsylvania it has been estimated that
such shortening amounts to about twenty-six miles
or, in other words, that the strata originally spread
out horizontally across an area whose width was
about 100 miles have been squeezed or folded into an
area whose width is twenty-six miles less.</p>

The strata were crowded together until they bent into great sharply
defined folds at the time of the Rocky Mountain Revolution several
million years ago. Then the rocks broke along the fault fracture and
the mass on the right was shoved over upon the mass on the left.

</div>

<p><a name="earth_movements" id="earth_movements"></a>We shall now turn to a consideration of sudden
earth movements and some of their effects, including
earthquakes. Mention has already been made
of the fact that, when pressures and strains are set
up in the outer portion (&ldquo;zone of fracture&rdquo;) of the
earth&rsquo;s crust, the rocks yield mainly by breaking or
fracturing because the rocks not being under a great
load of overlying material are there brittle. The
earth&rsquo;s crust has been fractured on small and large
scales in many places during the long space of
geologic time. Where one block of earth&rsquo;s crust has
slipped or moved past another along a fracture we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">» 87 «</a></span>
have what is called a &ldquo;fault.&rdquo; Such displacements
of rock masses vary in amount from less than an
inch to some miles, and they constitute one of the
most important features of the architecture of the
outer portion of the earth. There are two types of
faults fundamentally different as to cause. In one
type (so-called &ldquo;normal fault&rdquo;) the rocks suddenly
yield to a force of tension; a fracture develops and
the earth block on one side of the fracture or fault
drops with reference to that on the other. In the
other type (so-called &ldquo;thrust faults&rdquo;) the rocks
yield suddenly to a force of compression or lateral
thrust, and one block of earth is pushed or thrust
partly over another along the surface of fracture
or fault. (See <a href="#Plate_8a">Plate 8.</a>)</p>

<p>Faults range in length up to hundreds of miles,
those from one to twenty miles in length being very
common. Where an earth block has been displaced
thousands of feet along a fault surface, it is not to
be understood that the whole displacement resulted
from a single movement, but rather from a series
of sudden movements separated by greater or less
intervals of time. Each sudden movement along a
fault surface produces a vibration of the earth near
by. Many such sudden movements are known to
have caused violent earthquakes. Displacements of
twenty to fifty feet, as a result of single movements,
are definitely known to have taken place in various
regions during the last fifty years; and rarely, if
ever, has any sudden displacement of as much as
several hundred feet occurred. Cliffs and steep
slopes very commonly result from faulting, but,
because of the long lapse of time required for the
repeated movements in the case of great faults, the
cliffs or steep slopes begin to wear back and become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">» 88 «</a></span>
more or less subdued long before the last of the
movements take place. In regions where movements
along great faults have long since ceased,
the original steep slopes may be completely obliterated
by erosion.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 458px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Vertical sections through strata illustrating common kinds
of faults: a, &ldquo;normal faults&rdquo; where one mass simply sinks below
another; b, a &ldquo;thrust fault&rdquo; where one mass is shoved over another.
(After U. S. Geological Survey.)</div>
</div>

<p>How does the geologist determine the actual
amount of displacement, especially in the case of
a large fault in stratified rocks? First, the various
formations of the region, where unaffected by faulting,
are carefully studied, especially in regard to the
character and thickness of each, and their relative
geologic ages or normal order as they were deposited
one layer above the other. Then, in the
simple case of a normal-fault surface at right angles
to horizontal strata, it is only necessary to find out
what two formations or parts of formations come
together along the fault fracture, and the actual
amount of displacement is readily determined.
Where strata and normal fault surfaces lie at
various angles, and also in thrust faults, those
angles must be determined in addition to the data
above named. In many mining regions, where valuable
deposits are affected by faulting, accurate
knowledge of the direction and amount of displacements
of faults is of great economic importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">» 89 «</a></span></p>

<p>A few examples of normal faults from well-known
districts will now be briefly described. The
whole eastern front of the central and southern
Sierra Nevada Range of California is a great,
steep fault slope, from a few thousand to ten
thousand or more feet high and hundreds of
miles long, of such recent geologic age that
it has been only moderately affected by erosion.
In fact, it is well known that the southern
two-thirds of the range is a great tilted fault block,
the total displacement having resulted from repeated
sudden movements since about the middle of
the present geologic era. A great fault also extends
along the eastern base of the great Wasatch Range
of Utah and the steep slope thousands of feet high
is a fault scarp only slightly modified by erosion.
Renewed movements along this profound fault have
very recently taken place as proved by the presence
of fresh fault scarps in loose deposits which
have accumulated across the mouths of some of the
canyons, as, for example, near Ogden. In fact,
practically all of the north-south ranges of the Great
Basin from Utah to California are essentially a
series of tilted fault blocks. Another great fault,
less conspicuous from the topographic standpoint,
is hundreds of miles long in the Coast Range Mountains
of California. At the time of the San Francisco
earthquake of 1906 there was a renewed sudden
movement along this great fracture. The eastern
one-half of the Adirondack Mountains of New
York is literally a mosaic of hundreds of fault
blocks. Many of these faults are from two to thirty
miles long and they commonly show displacements
of from a few hundred to 2,000 or more feet. A
glance at the geological map (in colors) of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">» 90 «</a></span>
vicinity of the great copper mines at Bisbee, Arizona,
shows most of that region to contain a network of
normal faults which separate it into a mosaic of
fault blocks. In each of the examples of faults just
given a block of earth has sunk relative to the other,
or in other words, each is a &ldquo;normal fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We shall now turn to some large scale cases of
faults in which great masses of earth have been
pushed one over another&mdash;so-called &ldquo;thrust faults.&rdquo; In
the southern Appalachian Range, and especially well
exhibited in the vicinity of Rome, Georgia, one portion
of the mountain mass has literally been shoved
over another, at a low angle over a fault surface
many miles long, for fully seven miles westward.
Both the tremendous weight of rock material actually
translated and the number of sudden movements
required in the operation stagger the imagination.
It is safe to say that during the long time of
this great operation violent earthquakes were not
uncommon. In the Rocky Mountains of the northern
United States and southern Canada there is the
greatest known thrust fault on the continent. It is
hundreds of miles long, and the actual displacement
is commonly at least several miles. In the Glacier
National Park of Montana it has been established
that the front range portion of the Rockies has
actually been pushed at least seven miles, and possibly
as much as twenty miles, eastward over a fault
surface, and out upon the Great Plains. In some
cases rocks of the Prepaleozoic Age have there been
pushed upon rocks of the late Mesozoic Age, thus
locally upsetting the geologic column.</p>

<p>The Wasatch Range of Utah, in addition to the
great normal fault along its western base, contains
a remarkable system of thrust faults. In the
region now occupied by the Wasatch Mountains a
number of parallel (thrust) faults were developed
close together and the broken pieces of the earth&rsquo;s
crust between them were pushed up, the rocks on
one side of each crack riding up over those on the
other side until a great mountain range was formed
where once lay a plain. In the Ogden Canyon one
great earth block of Prepaleozoic (Algonkian) Age
has been shoved thousands of feet over late Paleozoic
(Carboniferous) rock, which latter has in turn
been thrust over early Paleozoic (Cambrian) rock.
This thrust faulting was accomplished before the
development of the geologically recent normal fault
along the western base of the range.</p>

</div>

<p>Any sudden movement of part of the crust of the
earth, due to a natural cause, produces a trembling
or shaking called an earthquake. Though earthquakes
are generally classed among the most terrifying
of all natural phenomena, those which have
occurred during human historic times have had
scarcely any geological or topographical effects of
real consequence on the face of the earth. Locally,
the effects may be notable and the destruction of
life and property may be great. The earth may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">» 93 «</a></span>
locally cracked and rent, small fault scarps may
develop, landslides and avalanches may result from
the shaking of the earth, buildings may be demolished,
and sea waves may be rolled upon the
land. On the other hand, many earthquakes, called
&ldquo;tremors,&rdquo; are too slight to be noticed by people,
though they are recorded by specially constructed instruments
called &ldquo;seismographs.&rdquo; We have already
stated that actual sudden displacements causing
earthquakes have amounted to twenty or even fifty
feet right along fault fractures, but during the
vibrations or quakings, which are often so destructively
sent out into the neighboring country, the
earth&rsquo;s surface rarely actually moves more than a
small fraction of an inch. Because of the suddenness
of the movement objects on the surface may be
moved inches or even feet. Violent shocks may last
one or two minutes and cause the whole earth to
tremble, though at distant points only seismographs
record the movement. It is probably true that some
part of the earth is shaking all the time.</p>

<p>Studies during the last fifty years have made it
certain that the main cause of earthquakes is the
sudden slipping of earth blocks past each other
along fault fractures, the sudden slipping furnishing
the impulse which sends out the vibrations into
the surrounding more or less elastic crust of the
earth. The low rumbling to roaring sound, which
sometimes immediately precedes an earthquake, is
probably due to the grinding of the rocks together
below the surface.</p>

<p>Earthquakes generally accompany volcanic outbursts
of the violent or explosive type, and in
such cases subterranean explosions cause both
the eruptions and the quakings of the earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">» 94 «</a></span>
It is well known that the principal volcanic
districts or belts of the earth are also the
belts of most frequent earthquakes, but this
does not mean that volcanic action causes most of
the earthquakes. Active volcanoes and earthquakes
are so commonly associated in the same belts because
those belts no doubt represent portions of the
crust which are now most actively yielding to the
forces directly resulting from the shrinkage of the
earth. Within the volcanic belts many earthquakes
take place unaccompanied by any volcanic action,
and many others take place far from volcanoes.
Some earthquakes have been caused by the impact
of great landslides or avalanches, or by the sudden
caving in of underground openings.</p>

<p>Brief descriptions of a few typical carefully
studied earthquakes during recent years will serve
to make the main features of earthquakes still
clearer to the reader.</p>

<p>The violent Japanese earthquake of 1891 was
caused by the sinking of a block of earth forty miles
long from two to thirty feet below that on the other
side of a fault fracture. There was also considerable
horizontal shifting, and cracks developed in the
adjacent region. A distinct fault scarp, fifteen to
twenty feet high, developed, and in some cases extended
right across cultivated fields.</p>

along which a renewed sudden movement of as much as twenty feet took
place to cause the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. (After U. S.
Geological Survey.)</div>
</div>

<p>The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was produced
by renewed movement along the great fault
which extends lengthwise through the Coast Range
Mountains for several hundred miles. It is literally
correct to say that, for 250 miles along this great
earth fracture, one part of the Coast Range instantaneously
slipped from two to twenty-two feet past
the other. More or less of the movement extended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">» 95 «</a><br /><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">» 96 «</a></span>
at least several thousand feet down into the earth.
In this case both sides slipped and the movement was
very largely horizontal rather than vertical. The
land on the east side of the fault moved south and
that on the west side moved north, the amount diminishing
away from the fault on each side so that
some miles out the actual crustal movement was only
a few inches. When one thinks of the tremendous
volumes of earth material involved in this shifting of
the earth&rsquo;s crust, is it any wonder that such destructive
earthquake waves were produced? Many buildings
were wrecked, several hundred people were
killed, the disastrous San Francisco fire resulted,
water mains were broken, and fences and roads
crossed by the fault were dislocated as much as
fifteen to twenty feet.</p>

S. C., was preceded by rumbling and roaring noises
and the slight quaking increased to violent shaking
which lasted more than a minute. Eight minutes
later a rather violent earthquake shock took place,
followed during the next ten or twelve hours by
less severe shocks. Most buildings in the city were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">» 98 «</a></span>
wrecked or more or less badly damaged, and some
people were killed. The shocks were so violent that
the quaking was actually felt by people over an area
of more than 2,000,000 square miles, the disturbance
having spread at the rate of about 150 miles per
minute. Near Charleston openings and fissures
were formed through which sand and muddy water
were ejected, but the cause of the disturbance was
most likely slipping of the old very hard rocks below
the loose deposits of the Coastal Plain.</p>

<p>From 1811 to 1813 a series of violent earthquakes
developed in the general vicinity of New Madrid, Missouri.
In an area of over 2,000 square miles, now
called the &ldquo;sunk country,&rdquo; many portions suddenly
sank giving rise to small fault scarps or cliffs, and
various lake basins were formed. Development of a
fissure caused a local change in the course of the
Mississippi River.</p>

<p>In 1897, Assam, India, was shaken by an earthquake
of unusual magnitude, which lasted 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
minutes. An area of 150,000 square miles was disastrously
shaken, and the shocks were distinctly felt
over an area of 750,000 square miles. A number of
notable fault scarps developed, the movement on
one having been thirty-five feet.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">N</span>OT only because of the great power and terrifying
grandeur of violent eruptions, but also because
of their destruction of life and property, volcanoes
stand out in the popular mind as among the
most real and important of all geological phenomena.
But great volcanic outbursts, like violent earthquakes,
are in truth only outward, sensible, relatively
minor manifestations of the tremendous earth-changing
forces below the surface. They are far
less important as geological agencies than the
mighty interior forces which cause parts of continents
to be slowly upraised and the rocks folded,
or even than the incessant action of streams whereby
the lands are cut down. Even as an igneous
agency, volcanoes are notably less important than
the development and shifting of molten materials
within the earth&rsquo;s crust. Volcanic action is, however,
not only conspicuous, but it is also of real
significance as a means of changing the earth, such
action having taken place since very early known
geologic time. After bringing out the main facts
and principles of volcanoes, aided by descriptions
of specific eruptions, we shall turn to a consideration
of igneous activity within the earth&rsquo;s
crust.</p>

<p>Mount Vesuvius in Italy is perhaps the most famous
active volcano in the world. Its eruptions have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">» 100 «</a></span>
been more or less carefully studied for a longer time
than any other. The eruption in the year 79 A. D.
was really a tremendous explosion causing a large
part of the old crater to be blown away, and sending
immense volumes of rock fragments, mostly finely
divided (so-called &ldquo;ashes&rdquo;) into the air which completely
buried the small city of Pompeii. Water
from the great clouds of condensing steam, mixed
with &ldquo;ashes,&rdquo; formed muddy floods which overwhelmed
Herculaneum. Little or no lava was
erupted. Since that time the crater has been more
or less active and the present cone, 4,000 feet high,
has been built up. During the last fifty years the
greatest eruptions took place in 1872 and 1906, when,
streams of molten rock flowed down the sides of the
mountain.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;Map showing the distribution of active and recently active
volcanoes of the world.</div>
</div>

<p>One of the greatest volcanic explosions ever recorded
was that of the island of Krakatoa, between
Sumatra and Java, in 1883. The greater part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">» 101 «</a></span>
island was blown away and there was water 1,000
feet deep, where just before the island stood hundreds
of feet high. About a cubic mile of rock
material was sent into the air mostly in the form of
fine dust&mdash;some of it for seventeen miles&mdash;and completely
hid the sun, causing total darkness during the
eruption. Dust fell over an area of several hundred
thousand square miles. Several days after the explosion
ships more than 1,000 miles away were dust
covered. Such enormous quantities of a light porous
lava called &ldquo;pumice&rdquo; fell and floated upon the sea
that navigation was badly obstructed many miles
from the volcano. Extremely fine dust gradually
spread through the whole earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, causing
the extraordinary red sunsets for several months.
The sound of the explosion was heard for hundreds
of miles. Great sea waves 50 to 100 feet high were
stirred up and they swept inland for several miles
over the low-lying coast lands of neighboring Java
and Sumatra, overwhelming hundreds of villages
and drowning tens of thousands of people.</p>

<p>One of the greatest explosions on record was that
of Katmai volcano, several thousand feet high, on
the coast of Alaska, in June, 1912. Not only was the
top of the mountain completely blown off, but also a
great crater pit, three miles wide across the top and
several thousand feet deep, was developed in the
stump of the former mountain. Volcanic dust fell to
a depth of several feet within twenty-five to fifty
miles of the mountain. Dust accumulated to a depth
of nearly a foot in the village of Kodiak, 100 miles
east of the mountain, where total darkness prevailed
for more than two days. A lake of very hot
water now occupies the bottom of the great new
crater. The noise of the explosion was heard for
at least 750 miles.</p>

<p>One of the most frightful volcanic catastrophes
of recent years was the eruption of Mont Pelée,
island of Martinique, West Indies, in 1902. In
this case, also, no lava was poured out, but
violent explosions sent great clouds of very
highly heated gases and vapors, mingled with
incandescent dust, thousands of feet into the air.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">» 103 «</a></span>
One of these great clouds rushed down the mountain
at hurricane speed and destroyed the city of St.
Pierre with its 30,000 inhabitants. After the main
eruption a spine or core of hard rock began to rise
out of the crater and it slowly grew to a height of
1,000 feet in several months, after which it began
to crumble away. This spine probably represented
nearly frozen lava which solidified as it was gradually
forced out of the mountain.</p>

<p>Of special interest to us, though not of great importance
is the only active volcano in the United
States. In May, 1914, Mount Lassen (or Lassen
Peak), a long inactive volcano in northern California,
suddenly burst forth explosively and
during the next several years hundreds of eruptions
occurred. Little or no lava appeared, but
great clouds of steam and dust often shot into the
air from one to three miles above the top of the
mountain, which lies over 10,000 feet above sea
level. (<a href="#Plate_10a">Plate 10.</a>) Great quantities of dust have
accumulated for miles around the mountain. At
this writing (October, 1920) the mountain is again
active.</p>

<p>It should not be presumed, however, that all, or
nearly all, volcanoes are of the explosive type.
Others of the more quiet type are well exemplified by
the two great Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and
Kilauea. Any but relatively very minor explosions
rarely, if ever, occur, the product of such volcanoes
being almost wholly lava, which flows down the
mountainsides in molten streams. The Hawaiian
Islands have, in fact, been almost entirely built up
by successive eruptions of lava, the building-up
process having begun well below sea level. Mauna
Loa rises to nearly 14,000 feet above the sea, but,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">» 104 «</a></span>
due to the fact that the streams of lava have spread
so far, the mountain has an exceptionally low angle
of slope which makes it difficult to realize that it is
so high. Considering its submarine portion, Mauna
Loa really rises nearly 30,000 feet above the sea
floor. Although Kilauea lies nearly 4,000 feet
above sea level on the flank of Mauna Loa, and only
twenty miles distant from it, the two volcanoes are
singularly independent in regard to their eruptions.
Each mountain has a crater irregularly oval
in shape, nearly three miles long, bounded by almost
vertical walls of hard lava, in some cases arranged
in terraces. The floors of the great crater pits are
relatively level, and consist of black lava in which
are lakes of molten and even boiling lava. The
black lava floor is, in each case, only a frozen or
hardened crust upon a great column of molten lava
extending down into the mountain. Prior to an
eruption of Mauna Loa the lava column rises hundreds
of feet in the crater, but during recent years
the lava seldom, if ever, flows out over the crater
rim. Instead, it breaks through the mountainsides
at various altitudes, the great flow of 1919 having
started at an altitude of about 8,000 feet. This
stream of liquid rock, fully one-half of a mile wide,
flowed for weeks down the mountainside and into
the ocean, the waters of which, in contact with the
highly heated lava, were thrown into terrific commotion.
In 1885 a stream of lava several miles wide
flowed forty-five miles. In one case, lava traveled
the first fifteen miles in two hours, but this is an unusually
great rate of speed. Lava streams in general
seldom move faster than one or two miles per
hour, and as the liquid rock gradually cools and becomes
more and more viscous, the speed diminishes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">» 105 «</a></span>
to zero. Almost incredible volumes of steam emanate
from streams of molten lava.</p>

<p>In 1840 an outflow of lava took place from the side
of Kilauea Mountain and ran into the sea. Since
that time the floor of the great crater pit (quoting
Professor W. H. Hobbs) &ldquo;has been essentially a
movable platform of frozen lava of unknown and
doubtless variable thickness which has risen and
descended (hundreds of feet) like the floor of an
elevator car between its guiding ways. The floor
has, however, never been complete, for one or more
open lakes are always to be seen, that of Halemaumau,
located near the southwestern margin, having
been much the most persistent. Within the open
lakes the boiling lava is apparently white hot at a
depth of but a few inches below the surface, and in
the overturnings of the mass these hotter portions
are brought to the surface and appear as white
streaks marking the redder surface portions. From
time to time the surface freezes over, the cracks
open and erupt at favored points along the fissures,
sending up jets and fountains of lava, the material
of which falls in pasty fragments that build up
driblet cones. Small fluid clots are shot out, carrying
threadlike lines of lava glass behind them, the
well-known &ldquo;Pelée&rsquo;s hair.&rdquo; Sometimes the open
lakes build up congealed walls, rising above the general
level of the pit, and from their rim the lava
spills over in cascades to spread out upon the
frozen floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In some regions, like the Columbian Plateau of
the northwestern United States and the Deccan of
India, each covering about 200,000 square miles, vast
quantities of lava have been poured out layer upon
layer to depths of even thousands of feet. Distinct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">» 106 «</a></span>
volcanic cones or mountains in those regions are
either absent or too scarce to look to as sources of so
much lava. Such lava floods were probably mostly
erupted from great fissures in the earth&rsquo;s crust, the
fluidity to spread many miles.</p>

<p>Some idea of the quantitative geological importance
of volcanism may be conveyed to the reader when
we assert that, according to a conservative estimate,
fully one-half of a million cubic miles of molten
rocks have been poured out upon the surface of the
earth through volcanic action in relatively recent
geological time! The Cascade Range with its lofty
peaks, including Mount Shasta and Mount Rainier,
each rising more than 14,000 feet above the sea, has
been built up very largely by volcanic action during
the last era of geologic time. Many other mountain
peaks and various ranges have been similarly developed
either wholly or in part. The great chain
of Aleutian Islands extending hundreds of miles into
the sea, is the scene of much volcanic activity where
a great mountain range is now literally being born
out of the sea by the processes of vulcanism.</p>

<p>Before this the reader has more than likely
wondered about the source of the heat, vapors
(mainly water), and power involved in volcanic
action. Answers to these questions are closely tied
up with the precise cause (or causes) of volcanic
action which remains one of the most uncertain of
the larger problems of geologic science. Before
briefly discussing the causes, a few additional facts
should be stated. First, in regard to the heat, a careful
determination of the temperature of the molten
lava of Kilauea in 1911 showed it to be 1,260 degrees
Centigrade, or 2,300 degrees F. This is, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">» 107 «</a></span>
a relatively low temperature, because many
lavas from other regions show melting points all the
way up to at least 2,000 degrees Centigrade (3,600
degrees F.). Water in the form of steam is quantitatively
one of the greatest products of volcanoes.
A fair idea of the tremendous volumes of water involved
may be gained from the statement that a
careful estimate shows that fully 460,000,000 gallons
of water in the form of steam erupted from a single
secondary cone of Mount Etna during a period of
100 days. Among other gases which are given
off in greater or less amounts during volcanic activity
are carbonic acid gas, sulphureted hydrogen,
sulphur dioxide, and hydrochloric acid. Some idea
of the power back of volcanoes may be gained not
only from the tremendous explosions such as those
above described, but also from the fact that the
pressure necessary to raise the column of lava from
sea level to the top of Mauna Loa (nearly 14,000
feet) is about 1,150 atmospheres, or about 17,000
pounds per square inch. The actual pressure must
there be much greater because the lava is forced up
from far below sea level.</p>

<p>A long-held idea that a relatively thin crust covers
a molten interior, and that downward pressure of
this crust due to earth contraction causes molten
rocks to be forced out, has been too thoroughly disproved
to now be at all seriously entertained. The
fact that near-by volcanoes commonly erupt entirely
independently, as in the case of Mauna Loa and
Kilauea, shows that there can be no universal liquid
beneath a relatively thin crust. Other arguments
against liquidity of the earth&rsquo;s interior are that the
earth acts like a body nearly as rigid as steel against
the powerful tide-producing forces, and that earthquake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">» 108 «</a></span>
waves which pass through the earth to a depth
of at least 2,000 miles are the kind which require a
solid medium for transmission.</p>

<p>Let us then briefly consider more plausible views
regarding the cause of volcanic action. First of all
we may be sure that the earth is highly heated inside.
Measurements in many deep borings show
that the temperature increases at the rate of about
1 degree F. for each 50 to 60 feet downward, to
depths greater than a mile. Accordingly, on the
basis of 1 degree rise in 50 feet, at depths of 20 to
35 miles, the temperature must be great enough
(2,120 degrees to 3,590 degrees F.), to cause all
ordinary rocks to melt <i>if they were at the surface</i>.
At such depths, however, the downward pressure
upon the rocks is so great that their melting points
are notably raised, and there is every reason to believe
that under ordinary conditions the rocks 20
to 35 miles down are not molten. If we adhere to
the older (nebular) hypothesis of earth origin, the
interior heat of the earth is left over from the cooling,
once molten, earth. On the basis of another
(planetesimal) hypothesis, the earth&rsquo;s heat is due
to the steady, powerful action of gravity causing the
earth to contract. In any case, the earth is hot inside
as proved by deep well records and igneous
phenomena in general, and it is a contracting or
shrinking body as proved by the many large scale
zones of wrinkling or folding of rocks. If, then,
highly heated solid rocks at reasonable distances
down in any part of the earth are subjected to
relief of pressure by an earth movement such as
upward crumpling of the crust, or by readjustment
of large fault blocks, such heated solid rocks would
become molten. The very earth movement which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">» 109 «</a></span>
brings about relief of pressure and melting may
very reasonably be regarded as the power which
forces some of the newly formed molten material
higher up into the earth&rsquo;s crust, and even out upon
the surface. This view harmonizes with the well-known
fact, already mentioned, that the main belts
of active volcanoes are also the main belts of active
earth movements, such as earthquakes.</p>

<p>Another source of power behind volcanic action
is steam pressure. We have already mentioned the
fact that vast amounts of water in the form of steam
escape from volcanoes or even from streams of
molten lava. The violent volcanic explosions are
quite certainly all, or nearly all, direct results of
sudden giving way of volcanoes to steam pressure
which accumulates during greater or less periods
of time, and with little or no possibility of escape,
without rupturing the mountain. Steam alone, or
combined with some of the other gases so common
as volcanic products, may also aid in forcing out
molten rock. What is the source of the steam and
other gases or vapors? According to one view they
were originally in the earth, while according to
another view the water at least has been absorbed
by the molten rocks from surface waters which
worked their way downward. At least two arguments
oppose the second hypothesis: first, that
not a few volcanoes are really many miles from the
sea or other bodies of water, while downward percolation
of rain water would fall far short of supplying
the tremendous quantities of water ejected,
and second, any water taken up by molten rock
must be absorbed within a very few miles of the
surface because, as we have learned, farther down
there are no openings large enough to permit the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">» 110 «</a></span>
downward passage of water, but, as a matter of fact,
the very upper part of the earth&rsquo;s crust is just the
place where molten rocks begin to give up their
water, often with terrific violence.</p>

<p>We may now turn to a consideration of the other
very important kind of igneous activity, namely,
the rise and transfer of molten materials within the
earth&rsquo;s crust, but not to the surface. The quantity
of such deep-seated (so-called &ldquo;plutonic&rdquo;) igneous
rock material which has been intruded into the
earth&rsquo;s crust within known geologic time, is far
greater than that which has been forced to surface,
that is the so-called &ldquo;volcanic&rdquo; material. The plutonic
rocks are always thoroughly crystallized, and
they are generally coarser grained than the volcanic
rocks.</p>

<p>Where molten materials have been forced into
cracks or fissures in the crust of the earth and there
congealed, we have a very common mode of occurrence
called &ldquo;dikes&rdquo; (<a href="#Plate_9a">Plate 9</a>). In many regions
often one set of dikes was formed, after which one
or more succeeding injections from the same or
different deep-seated bodies of molten rock took
place, and some of the later dikes were forced to
cut across earlier ones. Dikes of all lengths up to at
least thirty miles, and of all widths up to many hundreds
of feet, are known, but they are generally less
than a mile long and not more than a few feet or
rods wide. They have been intruded into all kinds
of rock formations&mdash;igneous, sedimentary, and
metamorphic. Dikes are common in many parts of
the world and they often excite the interest of lay-men.
They are wonderfully displayed along the
southern coast of Maine. <a href="#Plate_9a">Plate 9</a> shows small dikes
where the molten material was forced from a larger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">» 111 «</a></span>
mass into a body of older dark rock. The Palisades
of the Hudson River, just north of New York City,
consists of a layer of igneous rock several hundred
feet thick which, in the molten condition, was forced
nearly horizontally between layers of sandstone
millions of years ago, that is in the early Mesozoic
era. The palisade or columnar structure was caused
by cracking of the rock during the cooling and contraction.
This is the explanation of most columnar
structures of igneous rocks, exceptionally fine exhibitions
being at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway in Ireland,
and Devil&rsquo;s Tower, Wyoming (<a href="#Plate_10a">Plate 10</a>).</p>

<p>A type of occurrence not so common, but of special
interest, is where a body of molten rock rising in
nearly horizontal strata becomes cooler and therefore
stiffer or more viscous and, losing its power to
penetrate, forces its way between the layers causing
the strata to be arched or domed over it. Sufficient
removal of overlying material by erosion has
revealed many fine examples of this type of occurrence.</p>

<p>Another type of interest is the volcanic neck,
which is the core or plug filling the feeding channel
of a volcano. In certain regions, like parts of Arizona
and New Mexico, extinct volcanic mountains
may be all cut away by erosion, except the central
cores or necks which, both because they are more
resistant and are last to be reached by erosion, stand
out conspicuously as great towers on the landscape
(<a href="#Plate_9a">Plate 9</a>).</p>

<p>Most important of all from the quantitative standpoint,
however, are the great bodies of igneous rocks,
ranging up to many miles across, which, in a molten
condition, were forced irregularly into the earth&rsquo;s
crust from unknown depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">» 112 «</a></span></p>

<p>The common rock called granite belongs in this
category of rocks, which are the best and most
extensively developed of all igneous types. The
roots or cores of great mountain ranges often consist
of such rocks which are exposed to view only
after removal of great thickness of overlying material.
Immense areas of granite and other plutonic
rocks of extra deep-seated origin are exposed, because
of removal of overlying material by erosion,
in southeastern Canada, the Adirondack Mountains,
New England, the Piedmont Plateau of the Atlantic
Coast, and in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. All
the rock forming the lofty walls of Yosemite Valley
is granite, which was forced into the earth&rsquo;s crust
in relatively late Mesozoic time, and which has since
been laid bare by erosion.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></p>

<p class="caption3">WATERS WITHIN THE EARTH</p>

<div class="dropcap">I</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">I</span>T has been estimated that approximately 1,500
cubic miles of water fall upon the surface of the
United States each year. About one-half of this
goes back into the atmosphere by evaporation; about
one-third of it flows away in surface streams; and
the remaining one-sixth enters the crust of the earth.
Considerable water which enters the earth returns
to the surface as springs, by capillarity of soils and
rocks, or by being drawn up into plants and evaporated.
Some idea of the amount of ground water
may be gleaned from the statement, based upon a
careful estimate, that all the water in the rocks and
soils of the first 100 feet below the surface of the
United States would make a layer seventeen feet
thick. In most humid regions the soils and loose
rock formations are saturated with water at greater
or less depths (usually less than 100 feet) below the
surface. The surface of this saturated layer is called
the ground-water level, or more familiarly the
&ldquo;water table.&rdquo; The water table shifts up and down
more or less according to variation in rainfall.</p>

<p>In addition to the water held in the loose rocks
and soils near the earth&rsquo;s surface, large quantities
occur in definite layers (usually strata) of porous
rocks which very commonly extend at various angles,
hundreds or even thousands of feet into the earth.
A very fine illustration of this principle is the case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">» 114 «</a></span>
of the Dakota sandstone formation of Nebraska.
Almost anywhere across the State a well drilled
through a bed of clay and into the porous sandstone
layer encounters water. (<a href="#Fig_19">Figure 19</a>.) Another
principle is also well illustrated, namely, that water
in such a porous layer may actually travel
hundreds of miles, water obtained from a well sunk
to the Dakota sandstone having actually traveled
under the surface of the State all the way from the
eastern face of the Rocky Mountains, where rain
and melting snow entered the upturned and exposed
porous rock layer. Another good example is Iowa,
where certain porous rock layers outcropping in
the northwestern and northeastern corners of that
and adjacent States gradually bend down under the
State, reaching the greatest depths (up to 3,000 feet)
far in the interior. From wells 3,000 feet deep
near Boone, Iowa, it is, therefore, a fact that some
of the water pumped out of the earth actually traveled
underground all the way from beyond the
corners of the State. This sort of travel of underground
water is common in many parts of the world.
It should be clearly understood that such water does
not flow freely as in a pipe along subterranean passageways,
but rather it slowly works its way between
the grains of porous rock. Where such water
moves distinctly downward, and the porous layer
has both above and below it an impervious rock layer
like shale or clay, it gradually gets under greater
and greater pressure. In some cases such pressure
has actually been found by deep drilling to be equivalent
to that of a column of water several thousand
feet high. The rate of motion of water in porous
underground rock layers is very slow, data from
various sources indicating a rate of speed of not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">» 115 «</a></span>
more than one-fifth
of a mile a year in
coarse porous sandstone,
while in many
rocks it cannot be
more than ten to
fifty feet per year.</p>

<p>We still have to
consider a third
mode of occurrence
of waters within the
earth. Many formations,
like granite
and other types of
crystalline rocks are
neither in definite
layers, nor are they
sufficiently porous
to allow water to
really flow through
them. Where such
rocks extend far
down from or near
the surface, how
does rain water descend?
It does so
along cracks or fractures
(both joints
and faults) which
we have learned are
almost universally
abundantly present
in all hard rocks in
the upper (or zone
of fracture) portion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">» 116 «</a></span>
of the earth&rsquo;s crust. Joint cracks are generally
very irregular in direction and spacing, while fault
fractures are usually fairly regular and straight.
Many cracks are not wide enough to allow anything
like good passageways for water, while others
are sufficiently open to allow water to travel
along them for hundreds, or even thousands of feet.
In canyons of the West, springs not rarely emerge
from the bottoms of great, nearly vertical ledges
of granite and other hard crystalline rocks, the
waters certainly having entered the rocks hundreds,
or even some thousands of feet, higher. In
rocks of the kind here considered it is evident,
then, that the movements of subterranean waters
must be mostly exceedingly irregular and usually
not in great quantities. In many deep mines of the
world, underground water causes little or no trouble
except often near the surface. Occasionally a shaft
or tunnel strikes a prominent joint or fault fracture
filled with water.</p>

<p>What we might really call underground streams
may occur only under exceptional conditions in
rocks other than limestone, but in limestone they are
not uncommon because the slow solubility of the
rock allows underground waters to slowly enlarge
the passageways to form distinct channels. Echo
River, which flows through Mammoth Cave, is a
fine case in point.</p>

<p>Most water by far which emerges as springs,
was at one time surface water. A simple, but common
case is where rain water soaking through
porous soil (e.g., sand) or rock, sinks to the top of
an underlying impervious layer (e.g., clay) along
whose surface it flows until it reaches the side of
a valley where a spring results. In fact, wherever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">» 117 «</a></span>
the water table is crossed by the surface of the
ground, water must either seep or flow out. Where
underground streams which are common in limestone
regions reach the surface on hill or valley
sides, springs result. Another source of springs is
where under proper conditions of slope a porous
rock layer, charged with water well below the surface,
appears at a lower level than its source of
water. Still another type of spring is where a
fissure or fracture crosses a water-bearing layer
in which the pressure is great enough to cause the
water to rise to the surface along the relatively open
fissure or fracture.</p>

<p>In various localities we hear of springs in seemingly
paradoxical situations on tops of hills and even
mountains. Such a mystery is not difficult to clear
up. In the first place, such springs are rarely at
the summit of the hill or mountain. A case well
known to many persons is the small, but never-failing
spring a little below the summit of Mount Whiteface,
a peak in the Adirondacks, rising 3,000 feet
above the general level of the immediately surrounding
country. In this case, a mass of highly
fractured rock, subjected to much rainfall and lying
above the level of the spring, is sufficiently large
easily to contain and give forth enough water to account
for several such springs. In rare cases, however,
springs or flowing wells are located on summits,
and in such places it is only necessary to bear
in mind some of the principles above set forth,
but mainly the facts that water may travel under
pressure long distances underground, and that
the point of emergence may be on a hill which
is actually lower than the source of the water
far away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">» 118 «</a></span></p>

<p>The economic significance of underground waters
is forcibly brought to our attention when we realize
that 75 per cent of the people of the United States
depend upon wells for their water supply. Many
city supplies, most farm supplies, and much irrigation
water come from wells. The 3,000,000 people
of Iowa, for example, are dependent upon underground
waters from wells varying in depth from a
few feet to several thousand feet.</p>

of artesian wells. A, a porous stratum; B and C, impervious beds

water level in the porous bed A, or, in other words, the height of the
reservoir or fountainhead; D and E, flowing wells springing from
the porous water-filled bed A. (After U. S. Geological Survey.)</div>
</div>

<p>Most wells are simply dug to depths a little below
the water table. In humid climate regions the
depths seldom exceed fifty feet. The water encountered
in such wells is rarely under pressure. In some
regions of deep soils or loose formations, wells are
actually bored with an auger to depths of as great
as 200 feet. Deep wells in relatively hard rocks are
always drilled to depths of even thousands of feet.
In such cases the purpose is to strike either a porous
rock layer charged with water, or a crack or fissure
filled with water, the water almost always being
under pressure (sometimes very great), under such
conditions. These are called artesian wells whether
the water under pressure actually flows out at the
surface or not.</p>

<p>We may now inquire as to the necessary conditions
for artesian wells. This may best be done by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">» 119 «</a></span>
the aid of diagrams. <a href="#Fig_20">Figure 20</a> illustrates a very
common case where a porous layer, lying between
impervious layers, passing under a valley, comes
to the surface of the hills on each side where the
water enters the porous layer. On sinking a well to
the water-charged layer, the water rushes through
the hole to a greater or less distance above the surface.
In <a href="#Fig_21">Figure 21</a> the porous and impervious
layers are simply tilted, and the water under pressure
rises through the free opening to the surface.
Wells of this kind are also common in the Atlantic
Coastal Plain of the United States. In another case,
less comprehensible to the layman, the porous water-bearing
stratum curves downward under a hill or
mountain, water entering it where it is exposed on
each side. Under such conditions a flowing artesian
well cannot be drilled at or near the summit, but
since the water is under pressure it will rise in the
hole to a level approaching that of the lowest part
of the outcrop of the porous layer on either side
of the hill or mountain. This is essentially
the condition of things toward the interior of
Iowa, where water from the deeper wells rises
2,000 feet or more in the holes, but does not reach
the surface.</p>

<p>The drilling of deep wells, where records, including
samples of rock materials brought up, have been
kept, has been a great aid to the geologist in determining,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">» 120 «</a></span>
or rendering more precise, the knowledge
of not only the kinds of rocks underground, but also
the thicknesses and structural relations of the formations.</p>

<p>In yet another way deep wells are of special
significance, that is in regard to the light which they
throw upon the subterranean temperature of the
earth. Very recently the deepest well in the world
was drilled near Fairmont, West Virginia, to a depth
of 7,579 feet, in quest of oil or gas. At a depth of
7,500 feet, the temperature was found to be 168 degrees
F. Allowing for a near-surface temperature
50 degrees, this means an average rate of increase
downward of 1 degree in 62 feet. The second
deepest well is near Clarksburg, West Virginia,
sunk to a depth of 7,386 feet, with a temperature
of 172 degrees at the 7,000-foot level, or at the rate
Of 1 degree in 57 feet, allowing for a near-surface
temperature of 50 degrees. It is a remarkable fact,
that little or no water was encountered all the way
down. A well 7,348 feet deep in southeastern Germany
gave a temperature of 186 degrees at the
bottom, or a rate of increase of 1 degree in 54 feet.
These three records are about the average for the
deep holes of the world. Next to the deepest mining
shafts in the world are in the copper mining
region of northern Michigan, where over 5,000 feet
(counted vertically, not down the slope) down the
temperature is nearly 90 degrees the year round.
The rate of increase is here less than in most wells
of such depth, because of the cooling air currents.
Many years ago a rather remarkable experiment
in well drilling was tried by the city of Budapest,
Hungary, the attempt being to get a supply of water
at the brewing temperature of 176 degrees in order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">» 121 «</a></span>
to encourage the manufacture of beer. After getting
a good supply of water at a depth of 3,120 feet
and a temperature of 158 degrees, work was stopped.
In building the two great tunnels (St. Gotthard and
Simplon) through portions of the Alps, such high
temperatures were encountered that work was continued
only under great difficulties. In the famous
Comstock gold and silver mine of Nevada, over
forty years ago, temperatures as high as 157 degrees
were encountered in the shafts at a depth of
only 2,000 feet or a little over, the exceptional temperature
for such depth no doubt being due to occurrence
of the ores in geologically recent igneous
rocks which have not yet cooled to the normal temperature
for the depth of 2,000 feet.</p>

<p>From the sanitary standpoint, wells are of very
great significance, especially in view of the fact that
such a large proportion of people depend upon well
water. It is generally understood that typhoid fever
is more common in the country than in cities, in
spite of what might reasonably be expected. What
are some of the causes leading up to such a situation?
The idea that water purifies itself after flowing a
relatively short distance is, in many cases, far from
being true, especially when we are dealing with
underground water. Actual observations prove that
germ-laden water may travel surprisingly far
underground. Germ-laden water from barns, cesspools,
or outhouses spreads notably on sinking to
the water table and it is easy to see how so many
wells become contaminated. On general principles,
a geologist is especially wary of water from a well
in a barn yard. The well for human use at least
should be located out of reasonable range of such
contamination. Under the condition of the diagram
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">» 122 «</a></span>
a well or spring some distance down the side of the
hill may actually be unfit for use, though a serious
situation is much less likely to develop there. Nor
should one assume that by locating the well on the
uphill side of the house, and the outhouses or
cesspool on the downhill side, safety is assured.
From what we have learned in regard to earth movements,
and the tilting of strata from their
original positions, we know how the movement
of water in the saturated zone near the surface
may be downhill roughly following the hill slope,
while in a tilted porous layer of rock farther
below the surface the movement of water may
be in just the opposite direction. A well drilled
into the solid rock for safety on the uphill side of
a house might derive its water from this very same
porous layer, whose water has been contaminated
from a cesspool or other source down the side of the
hill. Such a case is by no means a theory or a
rarity. There is also real danger of contamination
in cases where the water flows more like streams
underground through cracks or fissures in hard or
dense rocks, or through channels developed by solution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">» 123 «</a></span>
in limestone. It may happen that water becoming
contaminated from barn sites, cesspools, or
outhouses finds its way along such a channel to the
side or bottom of a well. The author well remembers
the case of a farmer whose house, barn, and well
were close together on a little limestone terrace and
who continued to use the well water although he
complained of its disagreeable taste, especially after
a rain when he could &ldquo;taste the barn in it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 419px;">

</div>

<p>Finally, in this connection, it may be said that
wells should be located in the light of the principles
above explained, best of all upon the advice of
some one with geological training, and that, to insure
safety to health from the well water, sanitary
analyses (at small cost) should be made once or
twice a year. A bad well should be abandoned and
a new one sunk.</p>

<p>A large amount of money has been wasted upon,
and much mystery and superstition has surrounded
so-called &ldquo;water witches,&rdquo; or those who claim some
special or supernatural power of locating supplies
of underground water. Most common of all devices
used is the so-called &ldquo;divining rod,&rdquo; which is a
forked stick of willow, witch-hazel, or other wood,
according to the seemingly special requirement of
the operator. Certain mechanical and electrical devices
are also employed. With one fork of the divining
rod grasped in each hand and the main part of
the stick upright, the operator walks about until,
due to some &ldquo;mysterious&rdquo; influence, a place is found
where underground water pulls the upright portion
of the stick downward in spite of the grasp of the
holder. Some operators even claim to know just
how deep a well must be sunk. Without any attempt
to question the honesty of all operators, geologists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">» 124 «</a></span>
are in full accord with the following quotation from
a paper published by M. L. Fuller, for the United
States Geological Survey: &ldquo;The uselessness of the
divining rod is indicated by the facts that it may be
worked at will by the operator, that he fails to detect
strong water currents in tunnels and other channels
that afford no surface indications of water, and
that his locations in limestone regions where water
flows in well-defined channels are no more successful
than those dependent upon mere guesses. In
fact, its operators are successful only in regions in
which ground water occurs in definite sheets in
porous material, or in more or less clayey deposits,
such as pebbly clay or till. In such regions (which
are extremely common) few failures can occur, for
wells can get water almost anywhere. Ground
water occurs under certain definite conditions, and
just as surface streams may be expected wherever
there is a valley, so ground water may be found
where certain rocks and conditions exist. No appliance,
either mechanical or electrical, has yet been
devised that will detect water in places where plain
common sense will not show its presence just as
well. The only advantage of employing a &ldquo;water
witch,&rdquo; as the operator of the divining rod is sometimes
called, is that crudely skilled services are thus
occasionally obtained, since the men so employed, if
endowed with any natural shrewdness, become,
through their experience in locating wells, better
observers of the occurrences and movements of
ground water than the average person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It should not be assumed, however, from the
above statement that the location or foretelling of
underground water is mostly hopeless from a scientific
point of view. In most regions the kinds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">» 125 «</a></span>
rocks which would be pierced by wells can be more
or less accurately foretold by careful studies of the
rocks exposed at the surface. But foretelling the
underground water is often much more uncertain.
Where the geologic structure or arrangement of
rocks in a region is fairly regular, as in the case of
most sedimentary rocks, and a few scattering deep
wells have been drilled, with records preserved, the
geologist, by combining such data with his surface
studies, can do much toward putting the facts regarding
the underground waters of the region on a
scientific basis. There are many such regions, an
excellent case in point being Iowa, regarding which
State the United States Geological Survey has published
a report containing data by the use of which
it is possible to foretell almost exactly what formations
would be pierced by drilling from 1,000 to
3,000 feet or more, the thickness of each, which ones
are water-bearing and, in many cases, even the
character of the mineralization of the water for
almost any part of the State. Such knowledge,
through the years, is worth untold millions of dollars
to the State. Where the rocks are igneous and
rather uniformly dense, usually little or nothing
can be accurately foretold about the underground
water supplies, because in such rocks the water follows
exceedingly variable and irregular cracks and
fissures. In metamorphic rocks the difficulties are
usually about as great. In limestone regions, with
humid climate, much water travels in channels
underground, but these are so exceedingly irregular
that there is no way of locating them by surface
studies. In humid climates it seldom happens, however,
that a well does not reach at least a fair supply
of water within a few thousand feet even in rock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">» 126 «</a></span>
formations in which the water travels along irregular
cracks and channels.</p>

<p>Certain other important features of the geological
work of underground water should be brought
to the attention of the reader. One of these is its
power to dissolve mineral substances of many kinds
more or less rapidly. As already pointed out, limestone
is especially susceptible to solution in water,
both surface and underground.</p>

<p>The carbonate of lime taken into solution from
limestone is the principal substance which causes so-called
&ldquo;hard water.&rdquo; Most of the solution takes
place in the upper part of the zone of fracture of
the earth&rsquo;s crust and the dissolved substances are
carried along generally to the lower levels where
they tend to deposit (and crystallize), filling fissures,
cracks, and even tiny spaces between mineral
grains. Cracks and fissures thus filled by mineral
matter from solution are called &ldquo;veins.&rdquo; In many
mining regions valuable ores and other substances
have been deposited from underground water solutions
and concentrated in veins. In many places
underground waters with certain substances in solution
travel through various rocks or encounter solutions
of other substances and, as a result of chemical
action, many new mineral combinations result.
Such actions through the millions of years of
geologic time have effected great changes in many
rock formations. In the case of petrification,
like that of petrified wood, the buried organism
slowly decomposes cell by cell, and particle
by particle it is replaced by mineral matter from
underground water solutions. In this manner the
remarkable so-called petrified forests (not really
forests) of Arizona and the Yellowstone Park were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">» 127 «</a></span>
formed, the petrifying material there having been
the very common substance called silica which is
the same in composition as the familiar mineral
quartz. Mineral matter carried in solution in surface
streams is derived from ground waters which
reach the surface. An idea of the tremendous quantity
of mineral matter thus removed may be gained
from the statement that by careful determination
the Mississippi River carries 120,000,000 tons in
solution into the Gulf of Mexico each year.</p>

caves and galleries; and an arch (natural bridge) which is the remnant

</div>

<p>One interesting effect of the dissolving power of
underground water in limestone regions is the development
of caves or caverns. Most remarkable of
all is Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, with its hundreds
of miles of passageways and galleries. This marvelous
work of nature is all a result of the action of
underground water which has dissolved and carried
away vast quantities of limestone. Echo River,
which flows through the cavern, is still carrying on
the work aided by various underground tributaries.
The stalactites and stalagmites, which are so strikingly
displayed in many caves, as at Luray, Virginia,
in which water with carbonate of lime drips or
oozes from the roof and, due mainly to evaporation,
deposits the lime. Many wonderful and fantastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">» 128 «</a></span>
effects are thus produced. Where part of the roof
of a cave is dissolved out, or falls in, a &ldquo;sink hole&rdquo;
results. Where all but a portion of the roof of a
cave or underground channel has fallen in, a natural
bridge, like the famous one in Virginia, results,
though natural bridges are also formed by other
means.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter we shall briefly discuss
hot underground waters, hot springs, and geysers.
There are two well-known ways by which underground
waters may become heated. One is by the
movement of water downward into the normally
heated portion of the earth, the rate of increase
downward being, as above stated, 1 degree F. for
about 50 to 60 feet. Water descending two miles
would, therefore, attain a temperature of about 200
degrees F. In some regions such a temperature
may be reached at depths considerably less. Such
water (under pressure) taking a short course to the
surface (forming springs) at a lower level would
retain much of its heat taken up far below the
surface. In regions where there are great down-folds
of the strata (i.e., synclines), as in the central
to southern Appalachians, conditions appear to be
favorable for such warm or hot springs, as, for example,
at Hot Springs, Virginia. A second cause of
the heating of underground water is by the descent
of surface waters into contact with masses of still
hot igneous rock of relatively recent geologic age. In
some such cases the water does not go more than
some hundreds of feet down and when, under proper
conditions, it returns to the surface hot and even
boiling springs may result.</p>

<p>Geysers are periodically eruptive hot springs
found only in a few of the volcanic regions of the
world. They are most wonderfully displayed in the
Yellowstone National Park, where they send columns
of hot water to all heights up to 250 feet at
various intervals of time. Almost incredible
amounts of hot water are sent into the air every day
in the geyser basins of Yellowstone Park. The single
geyser &ldquo;Old Faithful,&rdquo; which erupts at intervals of
about seventy minutes, sends a column of water
several feet in diameter to heights of from 125 to
150 feet. During each eruption about 1,500,000 gallons
of water are sent forth, or every day enough to
supply the need of a fairly large city. A very brief
explanation of the cause of geyser eruptions may be
stated as follows: The very irregular, narrow,
geyser tube extends nearly vertically downward into
yet uncooled lava. The tube is more or less rapidly
filled by underground water. The bottom, or near-bottom,
portion of the water gradually becomes
heated by the lava until finally the boiling point is
reached for that depth. But, because of the pressure
of the overlying water column, the boiling point at
that depth is considerably greater than for the surface.
A little steam develops far down and this
causes the whole column of water above it to lift
slightly, thus relieving the pressure on the superheated
water far down. This relief of pressure
allows much of the superheated water far down to
flash into steam, which violently forces the column
of water out of the geyser tube.</p>

<p class="caption3">HOW MOUNTAINS COME AND GO</p>

<div class="dropcap">M</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">M</span>OUNTAINS constitute the grandest relief features
of the earth, and some of the most
profound lessons of earth changes may be learned
by studying them. To the layman who views great
mountains in all their grandeur and massiveness,
the expression &ldquo;everlasting hills&rdquo; seems appropriate.
But the geologist knows that even the loftiest mountains
are only temporary features on the face of the
earth. Like organisms, they come and go. For
example, where the great Rocky Mountains now
stand was only a few million years ago (in late
Mesozoic time) the bottom of an interior sea.
Where the Appalachians now stand there were no
mountains late in the Paleozoic era (not less than ten
or twelve million years ago), but instead sea water
covered the district. Then the Appalachians were
formed, lifting their heads much higher than at
present, after which they were cut down almost
to sea level, and then once more upraised. The
Coast Range Mountains of our Pacific Coast have
come into existence since the middle of the present
(Cenozoic) geologic era. Every mountain, like
every organism, has a life history, in some cases
simple, and other cases complex. All pass through
stages of birth, youth, maturity, old age, and death.
Some rear their heads and disappear after a short
(geological) existence. Others continue their growth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">» 131 «</a></span>
and persist much longer, while still others undergo
periods of profound rejuvenation.</p>

<p>Among the various processes by which mountain
ranges have been formed, the folding and accompanying
general uplift of strata are the most important.
In fact, in most of the great mountain
ranges of the world the folded structure is conspicuously
developed, so much so that they may well
be called &ldquo;folded mountains.&rdquo; Very commonly,
however, mountains of this type have also been subjected
to more or less fracturing of the rocks (faulting),
and not uncommonly they have also been subjected
to igneous activity, including both intrusion
and extrusion of molten material. It is among the
folded mountains of greater or less degree of complexity
that the &ldquo;greatest exhibitions of geologic
phenomena are seen and the lessons which geology
as a sciences teaches may be learned. If one desires
to know the history of a region, one turns naturally
to its mountain ranges, for here may be found
the upturned and dissected strata, a study of whose
kinds, thickness, and fossils throws light upon past
events, while their foldings and dislocations show
the nature and results of those great dynamic agencies
which, from time to time, have operated upon
the outer portion of the earth, and given to it the
broad distinctive features which characterize it to-day.&rdquo;
(L. V. Pirsson.) Among the great mountains
we may also see wonderful exhibitions of the
results of weathering and erosion, especially the
work of rivers and glaciers.</p>

<p>We can, perhaps, best convey to the reader some
of the main facts and principles regarding folded
mountains by considering certain observations
which may be readily made in a short trip across a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">» 132 «</a></span>
folded range of not too complex kind&mdash;for example,
across the Appalachian range along the line of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, west of Washington,
or the Pennsylvania Railroad, west of Philadelphia.
It would be most evident that the mountains
consist of strata, that is sedimentary rocks,
such as sandstone, shale and limestone, which
were deposited under water. A few measurements
would reveal the fact that thousands of feet in
thickness of strata are represented. Careful measurements
by geologists have, in fact, shown that
the strata were originally piled up layer upon layer
to a thickness of 25,000 to 30,000 feet. The fact
that they are strata of such great thickness proves
that sediments must there have accumulated under
water for some millions of years at least. Closer
examination of a few good exposures (i.e., outcrops)
would further reveal the presence of fossil
shells and impressions of marine organisms, thus
definitely leading us to conclude that the strata were
accumulated under sea water, which, of course,
means that the present site of the mountain range
was once sea floor.</p>

<p>Examination of the rock materials also establishes
the fact that the strata are such as were deposited
in relatively shallow sea water&mdash;that is to
say, none are at all of the sort which are now forming
under really deep ocean water. Most of the
strata represent original sands (and even gravels)
and muds which could have accumulated only relatively
near shore, that is within about 100 miles,
which harmonizes with a statement made in a preceding
chapter to the effect that very little land-derived
sediment is at present depositing more than
100 miles out from shore. The coarse materials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">» 133 «</a></span>
(sands and gravels) could not, of course, be carried
many miles out, while many of the strata are
covered with ripple marks, thus positively proving
their shallow-water origin. We conclude, therefore,
that the Appalachian strata are of marine, shallow-water
origin. But we have already stated that
these strata are at least 25,000 feet thick. How,
then, do we reconcile these two seemingly paradoxical
statements? All that is necessary is to realize
that the floor of the shallow sea, in which the sediments
eroded from adjacent land were being deposited,
slowly, though more or less irregularly,
subsided or sank during the long ages (millions of
years) of their accumulation. It would carry us too
far afield to really attempt an explanation of this
remarkable type of geologic phenomenon, and it
must suffice to suggest that, starting with the
earth&rsquo;s crust in equilibrium, the very weight of accumulating
strata would tend to destroy that equilibrium
and so cause subsidence.</p>

<p>In our trip across the mountains it would be
strikingly evident that the strata are no longer in
their original horizontal position, as they were piled
up layer upon layer, but that they have been notably
disturbed and thrown into folds (<a href="#Plate_7">Plate 7</a>), large and
small, some masses of the strata having been bent
upward (anticlines) and others downward (synclines).
Such folded structures could have been developed
only by a great force of lateral compression
in the earth&rsquo;s crust within the zone of flowage.
Under compression the strata were mashed together,
notably bent into curves (folds), and more
or less upraised. It would also be readily observed
that the main axes of the folds extend essentially
parallel to the main trend of the mountain range,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">» 134 «</a></span>
thus proving that the force of compression was exerted
at right angles to the trend of the range.</p>

</div>

<p>Using a biological analogy, a brief history of a
typical folded mountain range may be stated as
follows: First, there is the prenatal or embryonic
stage when the materials of the range are gathering,
that is when the sediments are piling up layer
upon layer relatively near shore on a sinking sea
bottom. Next comes the birth of the range when, due
to the great lateral compressive force, the strata
are thrown into folds and forced to appear above
sea level, the range thus literally being born out of
the sea. During the next, or youthful stage, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">» 135 «</a></span>
range grows (with increasing altitudes) because of
continued application of the compressive force.
Even during the youthful growing stage weathering
and erosion attack the range and tend to reduce
it. Then comes the stage of maturity, when the upbuilding
(compressive) force and the tearing down
(erosive) force about counterbalance each other.
At this time the range has reached its maximum
height and ruggedness of relief, with ridges and
valleys higher and deeper than at any other time.
The old-age stage sets in when the upbuilding power
wanes or actually ceases, and erosion dominates or
reigns supreme. Slowly but surely, unless there be
a renewal by an upbuilding power, the range is cut
down until little or nothing of it remains well above
sea level, or, in other words, until a peneplain is
developed. This last stage may truly be called the
death of the range. Usually, however, some local
portions of the disappearing range, which are more
resistant or more favorably situated against erosion,
are left standing to at least moderate heights
above the general level of the plain of erosion.</p>

<p>The above normal order of events may be disturbed
at any stage, especially after maturity, by
renewed uplift when the streams are revived in
activity and increased ruggedness results. Even
after the whole range as a relief feature has been
planed away, the site of the range may be uplifted
and a new cycle of erosion started.</p>

<p>By the use of two well-known examples we shall
not only illustrate the above principles of mountain
history, but also show that no less than a few million
years must be allowed for the growth and decay
of a great folded range. During the last (Permian)
period of the Paleozoic era the Appalachian strata
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">» 136 «</a></span>
began to buckle and the yielding to pressure continued
till well into the succeeding (Triassic) period.
The climax was reached about the close of the Permian.
Then, throughout the Mesozoic era, erosion
reduced the central Appalachians to a great plain
(peneplain) near sea level, after which, about the
beginning of the present (Cenozoic era), the site of
the former range was distinctly upraised (without
folding of the rocks), causing the revived streams
to begin their work of carving out the present
ridges and valleys, this work still being in progress.</p>

<p>In the case of the Sierra Nevadas, the strata were
folded into a lofty mountain range relatively late
in the Mesozoic era and, by the middle of the Cenozoic
era, the old-age stage of erosion was well advanced
when the range was not more than a few
thousand feet high. Then (in the middle of the
Cenozoic era) uplift, accompanied by faulting on a
large scale, but not by folding, took place, and the
range was notably rejuvenated to about its present
height. All the remarkably deep canyons of the
Sierras have been carved out since the rejuvenation.</p>

<p>How is the geological birthday of a mountain
range determined? In the preceding paragraph we
stated that the Appalachians were folded and born
out of the sea about the close of the Paleozoic era.
This is readily proved by calling attention to two
facts. First, the youngest strata involved in the
folding are of Permian, or late Paleozoic Age in the
geologic column, as proved by their fossil content,
etc., and obviously the folding must have taken place
after they had been deposited. Clearly, then, the
folding could not have taken place before very late
Paleozoic time. Second, the oldest strata resting
upon the folded rocks are of early (not the very
earliest) Mesozoic Age, and these strata are somewhat
tilted but not folded. Obviously, then, the
folding must have occurred before the nonfolded
strata were deposited, which means that the folding
must have been essentially completed in not later
than early Mesozoic time. Or, in the case of the
Rocky Mountains, we know that strata were there
folded late in the Mesozoic era or very early in the
Cenozoic era, because folded rocks as late in age as
late Mesozoic (Cretaceous) have resting upon them,
in some places, nonfolded strata of early Cenozoic
(Tertiary) Age. The figure clearly shows how the
Ordovician strata must have been folded before the
next (Silurian and Devonian) strata were deposited
upon them in southeastern New York.</p>

author.)</div>
</div>

<p>As already suggested, however, folding is not the
only method by which mountains are formed. Many
ranges are either entirely due to the tilting of earth
blocks by faulting or fracturing of the earth, or their
present altitude, at least, is a direct result of faulting.
Such may be called block mountains. They
are wonderfully represented by the various north-south
ranges rising some thousands of feet above
the general level of the Great Basin region of Utah
and Nevada. These ranges are, in short, somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">» 139 «</a></span>
eroded edges of approximately parallel-tilted fault
blocks lying between the Sierra Nevada Range and
the Wasatch Range. In southeastern Oregon a series
of nearly parallel block mountains, up to forty
miles in length and over 1,000 feet in height, show
very steep eastern fronts only slightly modified
by erosion.</p>

<p>Another mode of origin of mountains is by the
rise of molten material to the surface, especially
where a chain of volcanoes is located. Thus
the Cascade Mountains from northern California
through Oregon and Washington, including Mounts
Lassen, Shasta, Pitt, Baker, St. Helens, and
Rainier, are very largely the result of volcanic
action. The long chain of Aleutian Islands of
Alaska, referred to in our study of volcanoes, is an
excellent example of a great mountain range now
being built up out of the sea by volcanic action.
More locally molten rocks under pressure may not
reach the surface but instead simply bulge or dome
the strata over them, as in the case of the group
known as the Henry Mountains of Utah, and also
in other parts of the West.</p>

<p>In still other cases mountains of considerable area
and altitude have resulted from erosion of uplifted
regions where the uplift has been practically unaccompanied
by either folding, faulting, or igneous
activity. Any low-lying area, regardless of the
character of its rocks, structure, or previous history,
may be notably upraised and simply subjected
to erosion. An excellent illustration is afforded by
the Catskill Mountains of New York, where numerous
deep valleys and narrow ridges have been
carved out of upraised nearly horizontal strata.
The so-called &ldquo;Bad Lands&rdquo; region of parts of South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">» 140 «</a></span>
Dakota and Wyoming is also essentially of this type,
where deep, narrow valleys and sharp ridges have
been etched out of high, relatively soft, nearly horizontal
strata, resulting in an almost impassable
maze of mountains. In the high, recently upraised
Colorado Plateau of parts of Arizona, New Mexico,
Colorado, and Utah, nearly horizontal strata are
being etched out, the result being numerous buttes,
mesas (flat-topped hills and mountains) and deep
canyons, including the Grand Canyon with its maze
of peaks and pinnacles, many of them rising like
mountains out of the canyon depths.</p>

<p>Mountains of the pure types just described are
not the prevailing ones of the earth. Most mountains
and their structures, as we see them to-day,
are products of two or more of the processes of folding,
faulting, igneous action, and erosion. A few
well-known examples will suffice to make this matter
clearer. Thus, the Appalachian Mountains originally
developed by severe folding of thick strata.
After considerable erosion, numerous small and
large thrust faults developed, some of the dislocations
amounting to miles. Then the whole range
was cut down nearly to sea level by erosion, after
which the district was upraised (without folding)
mostly from 2,000 to 4,000 feet, and the present
long, narrow mountain ridges and valleys have been
carved out by stream erosion. Thus folding, faulting,
and erosion all enter into the height and structure
of the Appalachians.</p>

<p>A lofty mountain range still more complex in its
history is the Sierra Nevada of California. First,
thick strata were highly folded, upraised, and intruded
by great masses of molten granite. Erosion
then proceeded to cut the range down to hills, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">» 141 «</a></span>
which a great fracture (fault) developed along the
eastern side and the Sierra Nevada earth block was
notably tilted with steep eastern front and long
western slope. Erosion has considerably modified
the eastern fault face, and the deep canyons like
Yosemite, King&rsquo;s River and American River, have
been carved out of the western slope of the great
tilted fault block. Geologically recently the central
to northern portion of the range has been affected by
volcanic action, streams of lava in some cases having
flowed down the valleys.</p>

<p class="caption3">A STUDY OF LAKES</p>

<div class="dropcap">L</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">L</span>AKES are ephemeral features on the face of the
earth. Compared to the tens of millions of
years of known earth history, lakes, even large ones,
are very short lived. They may, in truth, be regarded
as merely results of the temporary obstructions
to drainage. Lake basins are known to originate
in many ways, and there are various means by
which they are destroyed. Not attempting an exhaustive,
scientific treatment of the subject, our
present purpose may be well served by describing
and explaining some of the better known and more
remarkable lakes of the world.</p>

<p>Even a cursory examination of a large map of
the world reveals the fact that the regions of most
numerous lakes are those which were recently occupied
by glaciers&mdash;either the vast ice sheets of the
Glacial epoch or mountain (or valley) glaciers.
This is because more lakes of the present time have
come into existence as direct or indirect results of
glaciation than by any other cause. A considerable
number of these lakes occupy rock basins which
have been eroded or excavated by the direct action
of flowing ice. Small lakes of this sort are commonly
found in the upper parts of valleys formerly
occupied by mountain or so-called Alpine glaciers,
because there the excavating power of such glaciers
was especially effective. More rarely rock basins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">» 143 «</a></span>
have been scoured out by glaciers farther down
their valleys. Many lakes occupy rock basins excavated
by ice in the high Sierra Nevada and Cascade
Ranges, in the Rocky Mountains from Colorado
into Canada, in the Alps, and in the mountains of
Norway. Few, if any of them are, however, large
or famous. Other lakes, some of very considerable
size, occupy rock basins scoured out by the passage
of the great ice sheets of the Glacial epoch in North
America and Europe, though they are less common
than formerly supposed. Some of the many lake
basins of Ontario, Canada, are quite certainly of this
origin, as might well be expected, because the power
of the great ice sheet was there in general notably
greater than south of the Great Lakes where the
tendency was to unload or deposit the eroded materials
as shown by the great accumulations of
glacial débris (moraines).</p>

<p>Where the ice walls of certain existing glaciers
form dams across valleys, waters are ponded, a
small lake of this kind occurring alongside the Great
Aletsch Glacier of the Alps, where its wall is slowly
moving past a tributary valley. Lakes of this kind
also occur in Greenland and in Alaska, but none are
of considerable size. During the Great Ice Age,
however, literally thousands of large and small lakes
were formed, both during the advance and the retreat
of the ice, wherever the glacier wall blocked
valleys which sloped downward toward the ice. New
York State furnishes many fine examples of large
and small lakes of this sort. Thus, when the great
glacier was melting in northern New York, waters
hundreds of feet deep and many miles long were
ponded between two ice lobes&mdash;one retreating eastward
and the other westward from the Mohawk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">» 144 «</a></span>
Valley. An ice dam lake was also formed a little
later, when an ice wall blocked the northern part of
the Black River Valley just west of the Adirondack
Mountains and caused a lake covering about 200
square miles. One of the largest of all known
ice dam lakes has been called Lake Agassiz,
which attained a maximum length of over 700
miles and a width of 250 miles in the Red
River of the North region of eastern North
Dakota, western and northwestern Minnesota, and
northward into Canada, most of its area
having been in Canada. It began as a small
lake with southward drainage into the Mississippi
when the great northward retreating ice sheet
formed a dam across the valley of the Red River of
the North. The retreating ice continued to block the
northward drainage until the vast lake, covering a
greater territory than all of the present Great
Lakes combined, was developed. Beaches, bars,
deltas and the outflow channel of this remarkable
lake are wonderfully well preserved. Lake Winnipeg
is a mere remnant of great Lake Agassiz.</p>

<p>Many ponds and small lakes occupy basins formed
by irregular accumulations of glacial (morainic)
materials. Still others lie in depressions which
formed by the melting of masses of ice which became
wholly or partly buried by ice deposits, or by
sediments washed into bodies of water which were
held up by ice dams. Depressions of the latter kind
are commonly found as pits or so-called &ldquo;kettle
holes&rdquo; below the general level of sand flats or sand
plains of glacial lake origin.</p>

<p>Most common of all lake basins of glacial origin
are those formed by accumulation of glacial débris
or morainic materials acting as natural dams across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">» 145 «</a></span>
valleys. This is, in fact, the most common of all
ways by which existing lake basins, some of them
very large, have been formed. Most of the thousands
of ponds and lakes of Minnesota, Wisconsin,
and northern New York belong in this category.</p>

<p>In the Adirondack Mountains, for example, most
of the lakes, like the well-known Lake Placid, Saranac
Lakes, Long Lake, and Schroon Lake, have their
waters ponded by single dams of glacial débris
across valleys. In some cases a series of such dams
blockades a valley and forms a chain of lakes like the
well-known Fulton Chain in the Adirondacks. Less
commonly the lake may have its waters ponded by
two natural dams of glacial débris, one across a
valley at each end of a lake. A very fine, large
scale example of the last-named type is the famous
Lake George in the southeastern Adirondacks. It
is over 30 miles long and from 1 to 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> miles wide.
It lies in the bottom of a deep, narrow mountain
valley, mountain sides rising very steeply from a
few hundred feet to 2,000 or more feet above its
shores. There are many islands, especially in the
so-called &ldquo;Narrows,&rdquo; thus greatly enhancing the
scenic effect. The valley itself has been produced
by a combination of faulting and erosion. There
was a preglacial stream divide at the present location
of the &ldquo;Narrows.&rdquo; This divide was somewhat
reduced by ice erosion when the deep, narrow body
of ice plowed its way through the valley during the
Ice Age. During the retreat of the ice heavy morainic
accumulations were left as dams across the
valley at each end of the lake.</p>

<p>Another remarkable body of water, similar to
Lake George in its origin, is Chautauqua Lake of
western New York, famous for its Chautauqua assemblies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">» 146 «</a></span>
It lies 1,338 feet above sea level, with its
northern end near the edge of the steep front of
the plateau overlooking Lake Erie. Chautauqua
Lake really consists of parts of two valleys, one
sloping north and the other sloping south, each
dammed by glacial deposits.</p>

<p>The famous Alpine lakes&mdash;Garda, Como, and
Maggiore&mdash;have resulted from deposition of glacial
morainic materials under conditions different from
those above described. In these cases great mountain
or valley glaciers once flowed down the valleys
and spread out part way upon the Italian plain.
Great accumulations of glacial débris took place
around the borders of the glacier lobes, and, after
retreat of the ice, the glacial deposits acted as dams
ponding the waters far back into the mountain
valleys.</p>

<p>The origin and history of the Great Lakes constitutes
one of the most interesting and remarkable
chapters in the recent geological history of North
America. Most of the salient points have been well
worked out and they may be very briefly summarized,
as follows: Before the Ice Age the Great
Lakes did not exist, because the region, prior to that
time, had been land subjected to erosion for millions
of years&mdash;a time altogether too long for any lake to
survive. Their sites were occupied by broad, low,
stream-cut valleys which were quite certainly locally
somewhat deepened by ice erosion during the Ice
Age. Ice erosion is, however, altogether insufficient
to account for the great closed basins. The two
most important factors entering into the formation
of the basins of the Great Lakes were doubtless the
great glacial (morainic) accumulations acting as
dams along the south side, and the tilting of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">» 147 «</a></span>
land downward on the north side of the region. In
support of this explanation it has been established
that the great dumping ground of ice-transported
materials from the north was in general along the
southern side of the Great Lakes and southward. It
has also been well established that, late in the Ice
Age, the land on the southern side of the Great
Lakes region was lower than at present, as proved
by the tilted character of beaches of the well-known
extinct glacial lakes which were the ancestors of the
present lakes. Such a down-warp of the land must
have helped to form the closed basins by tending to
stop the southward and southwestward drainage of
the region.</p>

</div>

<p>We shall now very briefly trace out the principal
stages in the history of the Great Lakes during the
final retreat of the vast ice sheet. This may best be
done by the aid of maps which need only brief explanation.
When the ice sheet had retreated far
enough northward to uncover the very southern end
of the Lake Michigan basin and a little beyond, a
small glacial lake (Lake Chicago) developed against
the ice wall. Its outlet was through the Illinois
River and thence into the Mississippi. At the same
time a larger glacial lake, held up by the ice wall,
developed over the western part of the Erie basin
and beyond. Its outlet was through the Wabash
River. With further retreat of the ice a large lake
(Whittlesey) covering considerably more than the
area of Lake Erie developed, with outlet westward
across Michigan into the enlarged Lake Chicago
which continued to drain into the Illinois River.
During a still later stage of ice withdrawal the remarkable
set of three glacial lakes existed&mdash;Lakes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">» 149 «</a></span>
Duluth, Chicago, and Lundy. Each of these large
lakes had its own outlet. Lake Duluth covered
about half of the Lake Superior basin and drained
through the St. Croix River into the Mississippi.
Lake Chicago expanded to cover nearly all of the
Michigan basin and continued to drain through the
Illinois River. Lake Lundy covered not only more
than the area of the Erie basin, but also considerable
territory north of Detroit, and drained eastward
alongside the ice lobe of the Ontario basin
through the Mohawk and Hudson valleys of New
York, and into the Atlantic Ocean. Just after the
ice completely withdrew from the area now occupied
by the Great Lakes, but still blocked the St. Lawrence
Valley, the vast body of water called Lake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">» 150 «</a></span>
Algonquin more than covered the sites of the present
Superior, Michigan, and Huron. At this time
the land was distinctly lower toward the northeast
than at present, causing the outlets to the west to
be abandoned. The great Lake Algonquin poured
its waters eastward through the Trent River channel
of Ontario, Canada, into glacial Lake Iroquois,
which was the great ancestor of Lake Ontario.
Lake Iroquois, in turn, had its outlet eastward
through the Mohawk and Hudson Valleys of New
York. For part of the time at least, Lake Erie
maintained a separate existence discharging into
Lake Iroquois near Buffalo. During the Algonquin-Iroquois
stage the combined area of all the lakes
was notably greater than the present area of the
Great Lakes. The volume of water discharged by
the lakes through the Mohawk Valley of New York
was doubtless greater than that which now goes
over Niagara Falls. Gradually, as the St. Lawrence
ice lobe waned, the outlet waters of the lakes began
to move alongside the ice through the St. Lawrence
Valley. Finally the ice withdrew far enough to free
the St. Lawrence Valley and the waters of the Great
Lakes region dropped to a still lower level, bringing
about the Nipissing Great Lakes stage not
greatly different from the present. East and northeast
of the Lakes the land was low enough to allow
tidewater (the so-called Champlain Sea) to extend
through the Hudson, Champlain, and St. Lawrence
Valleys, and possibly into the Ontario basin, as
proved by the occurrence of marine beaches and fossils.
The waters in the Erie and Ontario basins
covered about the present areas, while the Nipissing
Lakes, which covered a little more than the present
areas of the three upper Great Lakes, had their outlet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">» 151 «</a></span>
through the Ottawa River channel into tidewater
(Champlain Sea). Postglacial warping of
the land has brought the whole region to the present
condition.</p>

Valleys. (After Taylor, published by New York State Museum.)</div>
</div>

<p>Many lakes, including some remarkable ones,
occupy basins which are directly due to movements
of the earth&rsquo;s crust&mdash;either faulting or warping.
An example of a lake occupying part of a fault
basin is the famous Dead Sea of Palestine. This
lake lies in the lowest part of the Jordan Valley,
which has geologically recently come into existence
by the sinking of a long, narrow block of earth for
several thousand feet between two great earth fractures
(faults). The Dead Sea covers about 500
square miles and its surface lies about 1,300 feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">» 152 «</a></span>
below sea level, which makes it the lowest lake in
the world. Almost equally remarkable is the fact
that its depth is about 1,300 feet, so that the lowest
part of the lake basin is 2,600 feet below sea level.
The lake contains approximately 24 per cent salt,
mostly common table salt, causing it to be a thick
brine in which there is neither plant nor animal life&mdash;hence
the name &ldquo;Dead Sea.&rdquo; At one time, probably
just after the Ice Age, the lake was much larger
and deeper, when it filled a considerable part of the
Jordan Valley and had an outlet to the south. During
the high-level stage the water was fresh, but
gradually, as the climate became drier, evaporation
was greater than intake, the outlet was abandoned,
and the mineral matter (mostly chloride of magnesia
and common table salt) carried by the streams
in solution into the shrinking lake steadily accumulated
until the high degree of salinity of the present
time has been reached.</p>

<p>Great Salt Lake, Utah, is a remarkable lake
whose history has been carefully studied. It occupies
the lowest position of an extensive basin which,
in turn, forms but part of the whole great district
of Utah which has geologically recently sunk thousands
of feet on the west side of the great fault
already described as occurring along the western
base of the Wasatch Mountains. At present the
lake covers about 2,000 square miles, but its area
fluctuates considerably. It is scarcely believable that
this big lake has an average depth of only fifteen
feet and a maximum depth of only fifty feet. It
lies 4,200 feet above sea level, and it carries about
18 per cent salts in solution. Most abundant by far
is common table salt, of which there are no less than
5,000,000,000 tons in solution. The waters also contain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">» 153 «</a></span>
about 900,000,000 tons of other salts. Should
the lake completely disappear by evaporation, these
salts would be deposited. Allowing for cars 40 feet
long and of 40 tons capacity, a train more than 1,000,000
miles long would be required to carry the salts.
What has been the source of these salts? Great
Salt Lake is not, as supposed by some, a remnant of
an ocean once covering the region. Briefly, the explanation
is as follows: At one time, when the
climate was moister, the basin now only in part
occupied by the lake was filled to overflowing with
an outlet north into the Snake and Columbia rivers.
That great body of water (called &ldquo;Lake Bonneville&rdquo;)
covered nearly 20,000 square miles and its
depth was about 1,000 feet deeper than now, the
present depth being very small. Because it had an
outlet that lake was, of course, fresh. Beaches and
shore lines 1,000 feet above the present lake, and at
various lower levels, are still wonderfully well preserved.
When, due to climatic change, evaporation
exceeded intake by streams, the outlet was cut off.
But slowly, as the lake shrank, streams (especially
the Jordan River) carried a little salt in solution,
the percentage of salt increasing until the present
stage has been reached. In a real sense, much of
the salt was once in the sea, because it has been dissolved
out of strata which accumulated under sea
water long before the basin of Great Salt Lake came
into existence.</p>

<p>Another famous lake, which also occupies part of
a basin due to faulting, is Lake Tahoe in the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, near Truckee, California. This
lake, whose length is 21 miles, and width 12 miles,
lies 6,225 feet above sea level. On almost all sides
steep mountains rise several thousand feet above its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">» 154 «</a></span>
waters. Its great depth of 1,635 feet makes it, so
far as known, the second deepest lake in North
America, Crater Lake, Oregon, only outranking it.
The water is exceedingly clear. An experiment some
years ago showed that a white disk eight inches in
diameter could actually be seen through a thickness
of 216 feet of its water. &ldquo;The statement sometimes
made that &ldquo;Tahoe is an old volcanic crater&rdquo; is not
true. The region about the lake shows evidences of
volcanic activity of various kinds, and the lake
waters themselves have probably been dammed at
times by outpourings of lava. A lava flow appears
to have temporarily filled the outlet channel below
Tahoe City. The lake, however, lies in a structural
depression&mdash;a dropped (fault) block in the earth&rsquo;s
crust.&rdquo; (U. S. Geological Survey.)</p>

<p>The basin of the largest lake in the world&mdash;the
Caspian Sea&mdash;has resulted from warping of the
earth&rsquo;s crust. It has an area of 170,000 square
miles, a maximum depth of 3,200 feet, and its surface
is about 90 feet below sea level. The composition
of its water and some of its animal life indicate
that it was once an arm of the sea. It has been detached
or cut off by an upwarp of the land between
it and the Black Sea region. If this great lake is a
cut-off arm of the sea, with no outlet, how do we
explain the fact that its salinity is much less than
that of the ocean? Toward the north, where it is
shallow and fed by so much river water, it is, in
fact, almost fresh water. Even the southern one-half
carries not over 1 per cent of salt. The explanation
is that a steady current passes through a
narrow passageway into a gulf or bay on its eastern
side where evaporation is much greater than over
the general surface of the Caspian. The salt is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">» 155 «</a></span>
therefore, gradually accumulating at the estimated
rate of 350,000 tons per day in this gulf, while the
sea itself is becoming fresher.</p>

<p>The basin of Lake Champlain, about 100 miles
long, was occupied by tidewater geologically very
recently (that is, since the Ice Age), but it has been
cut off by uplift of the land on the north, since
which time the waters of the lake have been completely
rinsed out and freshened.</p>

<p>Many lake basins directly result from volcanic
action. In many parts of the world lakes, usually of
small size, occupy craters of volcanoes as, for example,
in the Eifel region of Germany, the Auvergne
district of France, and near Rome and Naples in
Italy. Such a lake of exceptional interest fills part
of the great crater, several thousand feet deep,
which resulted from the explosion of Mt. Katmai,
Alaska, in 1912. The water of this lake, more than
a mile wide and of unknown depth, is hot.</p>

<p>One of the most unique and beautiful lakes of the
world is Crater Lake in the Cascade Mountains of
southern Oregon. It partly fills a great, nearly circular
hole, six miles in diameter, with a maximum
depth of about 4,000 feet, in the top of a mountain
(<a href="#Plate_11a">Plate 11</a>). The lake is over five miles in diameter
and nearly 2,000 feet deep, making it the deepest
in North America. Its surface is about 6,200 feet
above sea level. Precipitous rock walls rising 500
to 2,000 feet completely encircle the lake, the main
body of whose water is of a marvelous deep, sapphire-blue
color, while the shallow portions around
some of the shore are of emerald-green. Crater
Lake has very little intake except direct rainfall
and snowfall, and its water is fresh. The great hole
was not produced by an explosion like that of Katmai,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">» 156 «</a></span>
but rather by the sinking of the top of a once
much greater mountain. That the mountain was
once about the size and shape of Mt. Shasta is
proved by the fact that deep glaciated valleys lead
up the slopes and end abruptly at the very rim of
the present mountain. Obviously these valleys were
scoured out in recent geologic time by glaciers
whose sources were several thousand feet up on a
former cone-shaped mountain. That the mountain
top sank rather than exploded is proved by the
absence of volcanic débris over the sides and base
of the mountain.</p>

<p>Still another way by which lakes are formed by
volcanic action is by streams of lava blocking valleys.
The famous Sea of Galilee in Palestine was
thus formed by a stream of lava, which geologically
recently flowed down from the east into the Jordan
Valley and across it, where it cooled to form a dam
ponding the waters of the Jordan River. Because
the river flows through the lake, its water is fresh.
One of the most remarkable facts about this lake is
that its surface lies nearly 700 feet below sea level.
A number of lava-dam lakes are known in the
Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains.</p>

<p>A very interesting case of a lake basin, formed
by cutting off an arm of the sea without any movement
of the earth&rsquo;s crust, is the Salton Sink of
southern California. This basin, many miles long
and wide, lies below sea level, its lowest point being
287 feet below tide. The Gulf of California formerly
reached much farther north and into California
where it covered the site of the Salton Sink.
Gradually the Colorado River, always loaded with
sediment, built a broad delta deposit right across
the gulf, the northern end of which thus became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">» 157 «</a></span>
cut off, leaving a big salt lake. But the river flowed
into the gulf, while in the dry climate the evaporation
was great enough to gradually dry away the
salt lake. This was the condition of things until
1904, when much of the river at a time of flood got
out of control and, following the general course of a
great irrigating canal, it flowed for several years
into the lowest part of the Salton Sink, partly filling
it to form a lake 45 miles long, 17 miles wide,
and 83 feet deep. Since 1907 the lake has been
notably decreasing in size, and it may entirely disappear.</p>

<p>Other ways by which lakes, mostly relatively
small ones, may develop are by landslides blocking
valley drainages; by streams cutting across winding
curves leaving so-called &ldquo;oxbow lakes&rdquo; which
are common, for example, along the lower Mississippi
River; by wave and wind action along shores
of lakes or sea; by filling so-called &ldquo;sink holes&rdquo;
which result from dissolving or falling in of roofs
of caves; and by beavers through whose industry
dams are built across valleys or streams.</p>

<p>Some of the most common ways by which lakes
may be destroyed are the following: by being filled
with sediment carried in by streams, or by vegetation,
or by both; by cutting down outlets; by
evaporation due to a change in climate; by removal
of the ice dam in certain types of glacial lakes; and
by movements or warping of the earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>

<p class="caption3">HOW THE EARTH MAY HAVE ORIGINATED</p>

<div class="dropcap">T</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">T</span>HE problem of the origin of the earth is
essentially astronomical rather than geological,
because geological history is considered to have begun
when common earth processes, such as erosion,
deposition, and transportation of sediments, etc.,
were brought into play. It is quite certain, however,
that the earth in its pregeologic state gradually
merged into its geological condition. For this
reason the geologist is interested in the more important
doctrines or hypotheses which have been
put forth to account for the origin of the earth. In
fact, one of the few hypotheses which must be
taken seriously is largely the work of a geologist.
The most acceptable hypothesis not only best satisfies
the facts regarding the earth&rsquo;s astronomical relationships,
but also best harmonizes with our
knowledge of the oldest known rocks and their
history.</p>

<p>Since the problem of the origin of the earth is
an essential part of the problem of the origin of the
solar system, the following well-known facts should
be clearly in the mind of the reader. Eight planets,
including the earth, revolve in nearly circular paths
around the central sun, whose diameter is 866,000
miles. The radius of the solar system is at least
2,800,000,000 miles, this being the distance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">» 159 «</a></span>
outermost known planet (Neptune) from the Sun.
Neptune requires 164 years for a trip around the
sun, while the earth, which averages about 93,000,000
miles from the sun, makes its circuit once a year.
The planets all revolve around the sun in the same
direction, and in nearly the same plane. The sun
and all eight planets rotate on their axes in the same
direction, the earth&rsquo;s rotation being accomplished
every twenty-four hours. Most of the planets have
one or more smaller bodies called satellites revolving
about them, such as Earth, with its one satellite (the
moon), and Saturn, with its eight satellites, etc. It
is well known that this solar system is only a very
small part of the vast universe, as shown by the
facts that no star is nearer the earth than several
trillion miles, and that some stars are so far away
that light traveling at the rate of 186,000 miles per
second requires a thousand years to reach the earth!</p>

<p>Toward the end of the eighteenth century the
famous nebular or ring hypothesis was set forth by
the astronomer named Laplace. This assumes an
original very hot incandescent mass of gas spheroidal
in shape and greater in diameter than the
present solar system. This mass rotated in the
direction of rotation of our sun and its planets.
Loss of heat by radiation caused the mass to shrink,
and this in turn not only made it rotate faster, but
also caused the centrifugal force (i.e., the force
whose direction was from the center) in its equatorial
portion to gradually become stronger. Finally
a time came when the force of gravity (i.e., the
force whose direction was toward the center) and
the centrifugal force became equal and a ring was
left (not thrown) off, while the rest of the mass of
gas continued to shrink. After a time the material
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">» 160 «</a></span>
of the ring collected to form the outermost planet.
The other planets were similarly formed from other
rings which were left off as contraction of the great
mass of gas went on. The sun represents the remainder
of the great mass of rotating gas.</p>

<p>What is the bearing of this nebular hypothesis
upon the early geological history of the earth? According
to the hypothesis the earth must once have
been much more highly heated and larger than now.
It condensed to a liquid and then it cooled enough to
permit the formation of a solid crust over a liquid
interior. It then had a hot dense atmosphere containing
all the water of the earth in the form of
vapor, and this atmosphere steadily became thinner
due to absorption by the earth. When the pressure
and temperature conditions became favorable, much
of the water vapor condensed to form the ocean and
the atmosphere gradually changed to its present
condition. According to this view the oldest rocks
of the earth must have been igneous because they
resulted from the solidification of the outer part of
the molten globe.</p>

<p>Within recent years certain serious objections to
the nebular hypothesis have been raised, and Chamberlin
and Moulton have formulated the planetesimal
or spiral hypothesis as an attempt at a more
rational explanation of the origin of the solar
system. Some of the objections to the older doctrine
are that among the many thousands of known
nebulæ in the universe very few only are of the
Laplacian or ring type, while spiral forms are
abundant. Spectroscopic study shows that the
nebulæ are not gaseous, but made up of either liquid
or solid particles, and that the leaving off of rings
would necessitate the assumption of an intermittent
process which could scarcely have operated
under the conditions of the hypothesis.</p>

nebula according to the planetesimal hypothesis of the origin of the
solar system. (Modified after Moulton.)</div>
</div>

<p>Anything like a full understanding of the planetesimal
hypothesis would be difficult to obtain, and,
in the brief space at our disposal, we shall attempt
to make clear only a few of the salient points.
According to this hypothesis the solar system was,
during a previous stage of its evolution, a great,
flat, spiral nebula, made up of finely divided solid or
possibly liquid particles called planetesimals, among
which were scattered some larger &ldquo;knots&rdquo; or masses.
Each tiny particle and larger mass or knot is considered
to have traveled in its own particular orbit
or path about a central very large mass&mdash;the future
sun. It is even suggested that the spiral nebula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">» 162 «</a></span>
originated by disruption of one star by a swift-moving
passing star. Each disrupted particle and
large mass at first started straight for the large
passing star, but because of change of position of
the latter the particles and larger masses were
gradually pulled around so that their paths curved
into spirals. Because of crossing of paths, the
larger masses or knots gradually increased in size
by accretion of the small particles or planetesimals.
Meteors (so-called &ldquo;shooting stars&rdquo;) which now
strike the earth are thought to be disrupted materials
still being gathered in, though very slowly at
present. After the passing star got well out of
range, the spiral paths of the disrupted masses
gradually changed to nearly circular, due to a wrapping-up
process around the central body (sun)
which then controlled the movements of the both
larger masses (future planets) and small masses
(planetesimals).</p>

<p>Let us now inquire briefly into the bearing of
this planetesimal hypothesis upon the early geological
history of the earth. According to this doctrine
the earth was never in the form of a highly heated
gas, nor was it ever necessarily hotter than now.
Instead of beginning as a much larger body which
has gradually diminished in size, the earth steadily
grew, up to a certain stage, by ingathering of
planetesimals. Increase in size caused the force of
gravity to increase and this caused not only steady
contraction of the earth&rsquo;s matter, but also a development
of greater internal heat. The earth has been
getting smaller ever since the force of compression
has predominated over the building-up process, because
of the diminishing supply of planetesimals.
Due to steadily increasing internal pressure and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">» 163 «</a></span>
heat the various gases, including water vapor, have
been driven out of the earth to form an atmosphere
which has gradually become larger and denser.
After sufficient accumulation of water vapor, condensation
and rainfall took place; the waters of the
earth began to gather to form the oceans; and the
ordinary geologic processes of erosion and deposition
of strata were initiated. According to this
view stratified rocks could have been formed very
early in the history of the earth, and in this connection
it is interesting to note that the oldest known
rocks are actually of sedimentary origin.</p>

<p class="caption3">VERY ANCIENT EARTH HISTORY</p>

<p class="caption4">(<i>Archeozoic and Proterozoic Eras</i>)</p>

<div class="dropcap">W</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">W</span>E shall now consider the older rocks of the
Earth, including those of Archeozoic, Proterozoic,
and Paleozoic ages. What are the salient
points in the very early history of the earth (not
including the evolution of organisms) shown by
these very ancient rocks? Beginning with the
oldest known rocks, it will be our purpose to trace
out the principal recorded events of earth history
in the regular order of their occurrence. As in
human history, so in earth history the recorded
events of very early times are fewest and most difficult
of all to understand. In spite of this difficulty
it is best to begin with the oldest known
rocks or, as Le Conte has said, &ldquo;to follow the natural
order of events. This has the great advantage of
bringing out the philosophy of the history&mdash;the law
of evolution.&rdquo; Because of limitation of space we
shall give special attention to the physical history
of North America, but the general principles
brought out apply almost equally well to the other
continents.</p>

<p>The Archeozoic rocks contain the earliest known
records of geological history, or, in other words, the
oldest recorded ordinary geological processes such as
weathering and erosion, deposition of strata, igneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">» 165 «</a></span>
activity, etc. Although we are here dealing with the
most obscure records of any great rock system, partly
because the rocks have been so profoundly altered
(metamorphosed), and partly because of the absence
of anything like definitely determinable fossils, it is,
nevertheless, true that certain very important conclusions
have been reached regarding this very
ancient geological era.</p>

<p>Among the very oldest of all known rocks of
North America are the Grenville strata, so named
from a town in the St. Lawrence Valley. In fact,
no rocks elsewhere in the world have been proved
to be more ancient. The Grenville series consists
of a great mass of sediments (strata)&mdash;original
muds, sands, and limes&mdash;which were deposited layer
upon layer under water (<a href="#Plate_12a">Plate 12</a>). The widespread
extent and character of the series in southeastern
Canada and the Adirondacks, and more
than likely far beyond these limits, make it certain
that the Grenville strata were accumulated on the
bottom of a relatively shallow sea very much as sediments
are now piling up on shallow sea bottoms.
Thus, the most ancient definitely known condition
of the region where the Grenville strata are exposed
was an expanse of the sea covering the whole area.
Wherever, in other parts of the world, the Archeozoic
rocks have been studied, stratified rocks also
seem to be the very oldest which are recognizable,
but up to the present time no such rocks have
been proved to be any older than, or even as old as,
the Grenville series.</p>

<p>It may occur to the reader to ask, how long ago
did the Grenville ocean exist? There are grave
difficulties in the way of answering this question in
terms of years since we have nothing like an exact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">» 166 «</a></span>
standard for such a measurement or comparison.
Although we must concede that not even approximate
figures can be given, it can, nevertheless, be
demonstrated by several independent lines of
reasoning that the time must be measured by at
least tens of millions of years, a very conservative
estimate of the minimum time which must be
allowed being about 50 million years. In any case,
the time is so utterly inconceivable to us that the
important thing to bear in mind is that the great
well-known events of earth history, which have
transpired since the existence of the Grenville ocean,
require a lapse of many millions of years, as shown
by revolutionary changes in geographic and geologic
conditions such as the long periods of erosion,
the enormous accumulations of sediment, the repeated
spreading out and disappearance of sea
water over many portions of the earth, and the
building up and tearing down of great mountain
ranges at various times. The ideas here expressed
will be much better appreciated by the reader after
following through the salient points in the history
of North America as set forth in the succeeding
pages.</p>

<p>Again, the reader may ask, by what line of
reasoning do we conclude that these stratified rocks
are so exceedingly ancient? All rocks of Archeozoic
Age, including strata as well as certain younger
igneous rocks (see <a href="#Archeozoic">below</a>), invariably occupy a basal
position in relation to all other rock systems. They
constitute a complex lot of crystalline metamorphic
rocks, combining certain characteristics which lie
below the base of the determined sedimentary succession.
Where rocks with the characteristics of the
Archeozoic are separated from the oldest Paleozoic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">» 167 «</a></span>
(Cambrian) strata by the great sedimentary or
metamorphic system known as the Proterozoic (see
below), we may be sure that we are dealing with
Archeozoic rocks. If the series of rocks in question
belongs in the Archeozoic system, all that remains is
to determine its age position in that system. This
can usually readily be done because wherever they
have been studied the Archeozoic rocks may be subdivided
into two groups of rocks, a sedimentary and
an igneous. Where the igneous rocks, mainly
granites and related types, occur associated with
the sedimentary rocks (e.g., Grenville), they very
clearly were forced or intruded, while molten, into
the sedimentary rocks, thus proving these latter to
be the older.</p>

<p><a name="Archeozoic" id="Archeozoic"></a>Since the Archeozoic strata of the Adirondack
Mountains, southeastern Canada, and also all, or
nearly all, other known districts are mostly badly
disturbed, tilted, and more or less bent or folded, and
since neither top nor bottom of the piles of strata
has ever been recognized as such, it is impossible to
give anything like an exact figure for the thickness
of the series. Continuous successions of strata
have, however, been observed in enough places to
show that they were commonly deposited layer upon
layer to a thickness of at least some tens of thousands
of feet. A thickness of over 100,000 feet has
been reported from southeastern Canada. The
clear implication is that the Archeozoic sea which
received sediments must have existed for a vast
length of time which must be measured by at least
some millions of years, because in the light of all
our knowledge regarding the rate of accumulation
of sediments a very long time was necessary for the
piling up of such thick masses of strata. It does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">» 168 «</a></span>
not, however, necessarily follow that the Grenville
ocean was many thousands of feet deep where deposition
took place. In fact, the very character of
the original sediments (muds, sands, and limes)
clearly indicates that the Archeozoic sea in which
they accumulated was, for most part at least, of
shallow water because such sediments have rarely, if
ever, been carried out into an ocean of deep water.
The great ocean abysses of to-day are not receiving
any appreciable amount of land-derived sediment.
Thus we are forced to conclude that in
Archeozoic time, as well as many times in later ages,
the shallow sea bottom gradually sank while the
sediments accumulated. Even more conclusive
proof of such subsidence has been obtained from the
study of so-called &ldquo;folded&rdquo; mountain ranges of
Paleozoic and later time, an excellent example being
the Appalachian Range.</p>

<p>Having established the sedimentary origin and
great antiquity of the Grenville series, we are led to
the interesting and important conclusion that these
oldest known rocks are not the most ancient which
ever existed, because the Grenville strata must
have been deposited layer upon layer, upon a floor
of still older rocks. If such still older rocks are
anywhere exposed to view, they have never been
recognized as such. Again, the fact that the most
ancient known rocks were deposited under water
carries with it the corollary that there must have
been lands at no great distances from the areas of
deposition because, then as now, such sediments as
muds and sands could have been derived only from
the wear or erosion of lands, and have been deposited
in layers under water adjacent to those
lands. But we are utterly in the dark regarding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">» 169 «</a></span>
any knowledge of the location or character of such
very ancient lands.</p>

<p>The most ancient known strata, as we see them
to-day, do not look like ordinary sediments such as
shales, sandstones, and limestones. They have been
profoundly changed from their original condition,
that is to say, they have undergone metamorphism.
The Archeozoic strata now exposed to view were
formerly buried at least some miles below the
earth&rsquo;s surface, the overlying younger rocks having
since been removed by erosion through the millions
of years of time. Far below the earth&rsquo;s surface,
under conditions of relatively high temperature,
pressure, and moisture, the materials of the strata
were completely crystallized into various minerals.
The surfaces of separation of the very ancient
layers of sediment are still usually more or less
clearly present (<a href="#Plate_12a">Plate 12</a>). Original limestone has
been changed into crystalline limestone or marble;
sandstone has been changed into quartzite, and
shale, sandy shale, and shaly sandstone have been
changed into various schists and gneisses.</p>

<p>In western Ontario there are also stratified
rocks (called the Keewatin series) which seem to be
of about the same age as the Grenville strata farther
east. A point of special interest in connection with
the Keewatin strata is the presence of layers of
lava in portions of the series, thus proving that
molten rock materials were poured out on the earth&rsquo;s
surface during the most ancient known era of the
earth&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>After the accumulation of the very ancient Archeozoic
sediments igneous activity took place on grand
scales when great masses of molten rock were forced
(intruded) into the sediments from below. Masses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">» 170 «</a></span>
of molten materials are known to have been thus
intruded at several different times, but of these the
most common by far cooled to form a great series
of granite and closely related rocks. The general
effect was to break the old strata up into patches or
masses of varying sizes as clearly shown by the
present distribution and modes of occurrence of
these igneous rocks. In most cases the strata were
pushed aside by, or tilted or domed over, the upwelling
molten floods&mdash;in many cases the molten materials
were, under great pressure, intimately forced
or injected into the strata; numerous large and small
masses of strata were caught up or enveloped (as
inclusions) in the molten floods; in some cases there
was local digestion or assimilation of the strata by
the molten materials, while in still other places large
bodies of strata seem to have been left practically
intact and undisturbed. Such igneous rocks, which
are very widespread, are all of the plutonic or deep-seated
types; that is, they were never forced up to
the earth&rsquo;s surface like lavas, but they solidified at
considerable depths (at least some thousands of
feet) below the surface. We see them exposed to-day
only because a tremendous amount of overlying
rock materials has been removed by erosion. These
igneous rocks are generally easily distinguished from
the old sediments of Grenville age because of their
more general homogeneity in large masses, and
their lack of sharply defined bands or layers of varying
composition. The fact that the minerals have
always crystallized to form medium to coarse-grained
rocks shows that these rocks solidified
under deep-seated conditions, since it is well known
that surface flows (lavas) are much finer grained
commonly with more or less of the rock not crystallized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">» 171 «</a></span>
at all. Slow cooling under great pressure favors
more complete crystallization with growth of
larger crystals.</p>

<p>As we have just learned, the very character and
structure of the Archeozoic rocks now exposed to
view show conclusively that they were formerly
deeply buried, and the inference is perfectly plain
that the overlying rock materials were removed by
erosion. Profound erosion of any land mass means
that the land must have stood well above sea level,
and thus we come to the important conclusion that
the great mass of Archeozoic rocks (both strata and
igneous rocks) were upraised well above sea level.
Just when the uplift occurred cannot be positively
stated, but in every region where the matter has
been studied it took place before the strata of the
next geological era began to deposit as shown by
the fact that such later strata rest upon the profoundly
eroded surface of the Archeozoic rocks.
Such an erosion surface, called an &ldquo;unconformity,&rdquo;
marks a gap in the geological record of the district
where it occurs. There is much to support the
view that the uplift was concomitant with the great
igneous intrusions, especially the granite. It is
reasonable to believe that the same great force
which caused the welling up of such tremendous
bodies of liquid rock into the earth&rsquo;s crust might
easily have caused a decided uplift of a whole large
region, but even so the process must have been
geologically slow. In regard to the height of those
ancient lands, the character of the topography, and
the drainage lines we are as yet utterly in the dark.
The fact that many thousands of feet in thickness
of materials were removed by erosion to expose the
once deeply buried rocks, does not necessarily imply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">» 172 «</a></span>
that the lands at any time had great height, because
it is possible that while elevation slowly
progressed, much material was steadily removed by
erosion. In the light of our knowledge of the
origin and growth of mountain ranges of later time
there is little doubt that at least some of the Archeozoic
lands were raised to such mountain heights.</p>

<p>Thus far in our study of the Archeozoic rocks
attention has been mainly directed to southeastern
Canada and the Adirondack mountains, where careful
studies have been made. In all parts of the
world where the most ancient known (Archeozoic)
rocks have been studied in detail the same general
principles apply. Particular attention has been
given to the Archeozoic rocks south of Lake Superior,
and in the Piedmont Plateau of the eastern
United States. In the accompanying map Archeozoic
rocks are widely exposed to view within the
areas shown in black. It has been estimated that
Archeozoic rocks appear at the surface over about
one-fifth of the land area of the earth. Where they
are not at the surface it is believed that they everywhere
exist under cover of later rocks. In other
words, Archeozoic rocks are considered to be almost
universally present either at or under the earth&rsquo;s
surface. This is true of the rocks of no other age.
Special mention should be made of the fine exhibitions
of Archeozoic rocks in Scandinavia and the
Highlands of Scotland.</p>

</div>

<p>All known evidence leads us to the remarkable
conclusion that the climate of much, or possibly all,
of Archeozoic time was not fundamentally different
from that of to-day. There must have been weathering
of rocks, rainfall, and streams much as at
present as proved by the character and composition
of the stratified rocks which formed in that remote
era. The presence of graphite (&ldquo;black lead&rdquo;) in
crystalline flakes scattered through many of the
strata shows that the climate must have been favorable
to some form of life, because graphite thus
occurring quite certainly represents the remains of
organisms, this matter being more fully discussed in
a succeeding chapter. In passing it may be stated
that climatic zones were then probably scarcely if
at all marked off, as they quite certainly were not
even during Paleozoic time. One of the great contributions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">» 174 «</a></span>
of geology to human knowledge is that
during the tens of millions of years from Archeozoic
times to the present the earth&rsquo;s climate has
undergone no fundamental change or evolution. In
the earlier ages there was greater uniformity of
climate over the earth, and, during known geologic
time there have been rather localized relatively
minor fluctuations giving rise to glaciers, deserts,
etc., but there has been no real evolution of climate
at all comparable to the marvelous evolution of
organisms&mdash;both animals and plants.</p>

<p>We shall now turn our attention briefly to a consideration
of the second great subdivision of geologic
time&mdash;the Proterozoic era. Rocks of Proterozoic
Age comprise all of those which were formed
after the Archeozoic rocks and before the deposition
of the earliest Paleozoic (Cambrian) strata, these
latter being rather definitely recognizable because
they contain fossils characteristic of the time.
Cambrian strata are, in fact, the oldest rocks which
contain anything like an abundance of fossils, so
that the separation of rocks of either Archeozoic
or Proterozoic Age from the earliest Paleozoic is
seldom difficult. But how may we separate the
Proterozoic rocks from the Archeozoic? Fossils
afford us no aid whatever, because no determinable
fossils have been found in rocks as old even as the
earlier Proterozoic. The two great groups of very
ancient rocks do, however, show a number of differences
which must be considered together. Thus,
igneous rocks distinctly predominate in the Archeozoic,
while stratified rocks predominate in the Proterozoic.
All Archeozoic strata are thoroughly metamorphosed
(changed from their original condition),
while large masses of the Proterozoic strata are only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">» 175 «</a></span>
moderately metamorphosed, or even unaltered, and
therefore look much like ordinary strata of later
ages. Archeozoic rocks have almost invariably been
notably deformed by more or less folding, tilting,
etc., while the Proterozoic rocks show relatively
much less deformation. Another important criterion
is the fact that the Proterozoic rocks, wherever
they have been studied in relation to the Archeozoic
rocks, always rest upon a profoundly eroded
surface of the latter, that is, an unconformity separates
the two great sets of rocks. This erosion
surface is of still further interest because it is the
very oldest one known, none having been recognized
within the Archeozoic group itself. Even where the
Proterozoic strata have been considerably metamorphosed
and deformed, this old erosion surface may
be recognized, and if the rocks below that surface
possess the characteristics of the Archeozoic rocks
as described above, the two great very ancient rock
groups may be distinguished. One of the triumphs
of geology during the last 25 to 30 years has been
the recognition of the great rock group (Proterozoic)
between the Archeozoic and Paleozoic, thus
bringing to light the records of an era which lasted
many millions of years.</p>

<p>The length of time represented by the Proterozoic
era is by many believed to have been fully as long
as all succeeding eras&mdash;Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and
Cenozoic&mdash;combined. Twenty million years would
be a very conservative estimate for the duration of
the era. What is the nature of the evidence as
recorded in the rocks which lead us to conclude that
the Proterozoic era lasted such a vast length of time?
The great thickness of Proterozoic strata (over 30,000
feet in the Lake Superior region), in the light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">» 176 «</a></span>
of what we have already learned regarding the present
rate of wear (erosion) of lands and deposition
of the eroded materials under ordinary conditions,
clearly implies millions of years of time for their
accumulation. But the Proterozoic strata as we now
see them are in most places not a continuous pile,
that is they were not accumulated layer upon layer
without notable interruption. Thus, the thick Proterozoic
group of the Lake Superior region has been
divided into four distinct, mainly sedimentary series
separated from each other by erosion surfaces (unconformities).
Each erosion surface represents a
long time when the area was elevated and underwent
profound wear before the next series of strata
accumulated on the worn surface. That such times
of erosion were geologically long is proved not only
by the profound alteration (metamorphism) of one
set of strata before another accumulated, but also
by the fact that granite, which, as we have learned,
is never exposed except where much overlying material
has been eroded, actually formed parts of surfaces
of earlier Proterozoic rocks upon which later
ones were deposited. In the Lake Superior region
there are not only three great erosion surfaces (unconformities)
within the Proterozoic group, but also
one at the base separating it as a whole from the
Archeozoic group, and another at the top separating
it from the Paleozoic group. It is, therefore,
fair to conclude that the amount of time (millions
of years) represented by these great erosion intervals
was fully as great as the time needed for
deposition of the existing Proterozoic strata.</p>

<p>In the Lake Superior region the older Proterozoic
strata are nearly all more or less folded and altered
(metamorphosed), and they have been intruded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">» 177 «</a></span>
considerable bodies of molten rock, mostly granite.
The later Proterozoic strata have been much less deformed
and in many cases they are practically unaltered.
In this region a very remarkable event
took place in late Proterozoic time. This was volcanic
activity on a grand scale. We may gain some
idea of the stupendous and long-continued volcanic
outpourings from the fact that, based upon actual
measurements of thickness, lava sheets, averaging
about 100 feet thick, poured out one upon another
until a pile about six miles high had accumulated.</p>

<p>In parts of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado
tilted Proterozoic strata may be seen resting upon
the profoundly eroded surface of the Archeozoic
rocks of the inner gorge. The Proterozoic strata,
12,000 feet thick, consist of practically unaltered
sandstones, shales, and limestones, associated with
some layers of basaltic lava. An erosion surface
(unconformity) separates the whole group into two
distinct series, and the group is separated from the
overlying nearly horizontal Paleozoic (Cambrian)
strata in the walls of the Canyon by another erosion
surface.</p>

<p>More recently the Proterozoic strata so finely displayed
in the Rocky Mountains of Montana and
southern Canada have been studied. These strata, at
least two or three miles thick, are mostly unaltered
sandstones, shales, and limestones, associated with
some metamorphic and igneous rocks. As usual,
these strata rest upon the eroded Archeozoic. They
were more or less upturned and folded before deposition
of the succeeding Paleozoic strata. Satisfactory
subdivisions have not yet been worked out.</p>

<p>In North America most of the areas shown on the
accompanying map contain more or less Proterozoic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">» 178 «</a></span>
rocks. Rocks of this age are known to some extent
in all continents where their general relationships
seem to be much like those of North America. They
have perhaps been most carefully studied in Scandinavia
and the Highlands of Scotland, where the
strata portions are about two miles thick.</p>

<p>The climate of Proterozoic time must, for most
part, have been about like that of to-day except, of
course, for its much greater uniformity over the
earth. About a dozen years ago very typical glacial
deposits were discovered within the early Proterozoic
rocks of western Ontario, Canada. A climatic
condition favorable for the development of glaciers
so early in the history of the earth is, to say the
least, directly opposed to an idea (based upon the
nebular hypothesis) long held that the climate of
early geologic time must have been much warmer
than that of the present.</p>

<p class="caption4">(<i>Paleozoic Era</i>)</p>

<div class="dropcap">B</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">B</span>EGINNING with the earliest Paleozoic, the
legible records of events of earth history are far
more abundant and less defaced than those of earlier
times. Stratified rocks of the ordinary kinds greatly
predominate over the igneous and metamorphic
rocks, and the strata are in general far less disturbed
than those of the Archeozoic and Proterozoic groups.
From the earliest Paleozoic we have also the first
abundant records (fossils) of the life of the earth,
so that the ordinary methods of subdividing and
determining the relative ages of the Paleozoic and
later strata, as well as correlating the subdivisions
(formations) in widely separated regions, can be
used. From here on in our discussion of earth history
we shall be able to trace the salient features
of the changing outlines of the face of the earth,
the coming and going of the seas over the lands, and
the evolution of animals and plants with a considerable
degree of definiteness and satisfaction.</p>

<p>First, we shall trace out, in the regular order of
their occurrence, the main physical history events
of Paleozoic time, leaving a consideration of the
evolution of life for other chapters. Because of
limitation of space, our attention will be almost
wholly centered upon the continent of North America,
but the reader should bear in mind that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">» 180 «</a></span>
general principles and facts set forth apply with
about equal force to most other continents. In
Europe the wonderful records of Paleozoic history
are found in strata, whose estimated maximum
thickness is about 100,000 feet! It must not be
thought, however, that all these strata are piled up
in a single locality, but the figure does actually represent
the sum total of the greatest thickness of the
many subdivisions (formations) of the Paleozoic
rocks in different portions of the continent. In North
America the maximum thickness of all Paleozoic
rocks seems to be no less than 50,000 feet. More
than 25,000 feet of strata may actually be observed
piled layer upon layer in the highly folded and deeply
eroded central Appalachian Mountains. The great
thickness of the strata, combined with the facts that
the fossils show that many marvelous, mostly progressive,
changes took place among living things,
that seas came and went repeatedly over many parts
of the continent, and that great changes took place
in the configuration of the land, force us to conclude
that Paleozoic time must have lasted for many
millions of years.</p>

<p>Just before the opening of the Paleozoic era practically
all of North America appears to have been
dry land, which had undergone so much erosion that
it was low and far less rugged in relief than at
present. This we know, because the rather widespread
early Paleozoic (Cambrian) strata almost
everywhere rest upon deeply eroded rocks of either
Archeozoic or Proterozoic age. Considering both
the time involved and the wide area affected, we
have no record of anything like such a profound
erosion interval since the beginning of the Paleozoic
era. It seems that the constructive or upbuilding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">» 181 «</a></span>
forces within the earth were then remarkably
quiescent, while the destructive forces (erosion)
were almost unhampered in their work of cutting
down the land.</p>

<p>Have we any definite idea of the relations of land
and water in North America during the first or
Cambrian period of the Paleozoic era? In the affirmative
answer to this question, certain principles
will be brought out which the reader should keep in
mind as we trace out the succeeding great physical
changes in the history of North America. It should,
however, be remembered that, in the brief space at
our disposal, only the most general, or the most
significant localized, physical changes in the long
and intricate known history of the continent since
the opening of the Paleozoic era can be brought out.</p>

<p>In early Cambrian time a narrow arm of the sea
(like a strait) extended from the Gulf of St.
Lawrence southward across eastern New York and
over the site of the present Appalachian Mountains
connecting with the Gulf of Mexico on the south.
On the west, a much larger and broader arm of the
sea (like a mediterranean) extended from Alaska
southward over the site of the Rocky Mountains of
Canada and across the sites of the Columbia Plateau
to Great Basin of the western United States. All
the rest of the continent was land, apparently almost
or wholly devoid of high mountains.</p>

<p>By what process of reasoning do we conclude that
arms of the early Cambrian sea reached across eastern
and western North America? First, wherever
marine strata of definitely determined early Cambrian
age now occur, the early Cambrian sea must
have existed because those strata were obviously deposited
in that sea. Second, to those areas we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">» 182 «</a></span>
add others from which it can be demonstrated that
early Cambrian marine strata have been removed
by erosion. Enough field work along these lines has
been done in North America to render it practically
certain that the relations of land and water during
early Cambrian time were essentially as above outlined.</p>

</div>

<p>As Cambrian time went on, the marine waters
gradually spread from south to north across most of
the Mississippi Valley area, causing the eastern and
western arms of the sea to be connected, thus forming
an interior continental sea. Otherwise the relations
of land and water were much as in early
Cambrian time. We know that the sea transgressed
northward across the Mississippi Valley district because,
on the south, the whole Cambrian system of
strata (lower, middle, and upper) is present, while,
farther north, only middle and upper Cambrian are
present, and, farthest north, only upper Cambrian
strata occur. This progressive northward overlap
of younger and younger (later) Cambrian strata
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">» 184 «</a></span>
upon the old rock floor proves, that the Cambrian
sea steadily spread farther and farther northward
over the Mississippi Valley area. That this spreading
sea was shallow is amply demonstrated by the
deposits it left, such as shales, conglomerates (i.e.,
consolidated gravels) and sandstones, often ripple-marked.
The Cambrian strata of North America
vary in thickness from less than 1,000 feet to about
12,000 feet.</p>

<p>In the Mississippi Valley the Cambrian strata are
unaltered and almost undisturbed from their original
horizontal position. In the Appalachian Mountains
of the east, and the Rocky Mountains of the
west, the strata are commonly notably folded and
faulted. In some places, as in western New England,
the strata have been notably altered (metamorphosed).</p>

<p>The best estimates for the duration of the Cambrian
period range from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000
years. It is a remarkable fact that, during this great
lapse of time, North America was unaffected by
any great physical disturbances such as mountain
making, emergence of large tracts of land, or igneous
activity. The one great physical event of the Cambrian
was the gradual submergence of a considerable
portion of the continent.</p>

<p>That the climate of the earliest Cambrian was
at least locally favorable for the existence of glaciers,
is proved by the occurrences of true glacial deposits
in rocks of that age in China, Norway, and Australia.
It is a remarkable fact that the glacial
materials of China occur along the Yangtse River,
thus demonstrating that conditions for glaciers then
existed at a latitude as far south as New Orleans.
These evidences of glaciation directly refute the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">» 185 «</a></span>
idea, based upon the nebular hypothesis, that the
climate of the Paleozoic was distinctly warmer than
now. The glacial evidence, added to our knowledge
of the character and world-wide distribution of
many identical species of animals, leads us to conclude
that early Paleozoic climate was not essentially
different from that of very recent geologic time, but
that the climate was then much more uniform than
at present.</p>

<p>During the second or Ordovician period of the
Paleozoic era, the progressive submergence of Cambrian
time continued until a climax was reached
toward the middle of the period when fully four-fifths
of the continent was submerged under shallow
sea water. Since middle Ordovician marine strata
are more widespread than the rocks of any succeeding
age, we can be reasonably sure that so much of the
continent was never again covered by the sea. In
fact, so far as the records have been interpreted, this
came nearest to being a universal flood in the whole
known history of the continent. By the very character
of the rocks deposited (seldom over a few
thousand feet thick), we can be sure that the middle
Ordovician continental sea was everywhere far
shallower than the great ocean abysses of to-day.
Because the lands were so low and restricted, relatively
little land-derived sediment washed into the
sea. But the shallow sea water was inhabited by
millions of animals, the shells of many of which
slowly accumulated to build up the thick bodies of
limestone strata (<a href="#Plate_14a">Plate 14</a>) which constitute the
main bulk of rock of early and middle Ordovician
age. The famous Trenton limestone, named from
a locality in central New York, with its great
abundance of fossils, was formed mostly by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">» 186 «</a></span>
accumulation of shells of animals during middle
Ordovician time.</p>

<p>Later in the Ordovician there was a considerable
shift in level between land and water causing a
withdrawal of much of the widespread sea. As a
result of the generally more elevated lands, erosion
proceeded more vigorously, and sands and muds
were more abundantly deposited in the restricted
sea, these sediments having consolidated to form the
shales and sandstones which predominate among
the upper Ordovician rocks.</p>

<p>A principle above briefly explained in the discussion
of the Cambrian may be reemphasized here.
It is as follows: In making a map to show the relations
of land and water, say during middle
Ordovician time, the geologist is by no means dependent
only upon actual surface exposures of
middle Ordovician strata. Such exposures fall far
short of giving an adequate conception of the former
or even present real extent of such strata. In many
places originally present Ordovician strata have been
removed by erosion. An excellent case in point is the
Adirondack region of northern New York. On the
west side of the Adirondacks a great pile of marine
Ordovician strata 1,500 feet thick end abruptly on
the gently sloping flank of the mountains, thus
clearly proving that the strata formerly extended at
least twenty to thirty miles eastward. Again, in
the southern Adirondacks a small area of very typical
marine middle Ordovician strata lies fully fifteen
miles from the general area of such rocks to the
south. This small body of rock is very clearly only
an erosion remnant of a general sheet of middle
Ordovician rock which once covered the whole intervening
district. In many other regions the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">» 187 «</a></span>
middle Ordovician strata are definitely known to be
concealed under cover of later rocks, as in the Mississippi
Valley, where the actual surface exposures constitute
only a fraction of the middle Ordovician strata
which underlie nearly all the valley, as proved by
deep well drillings, study of the scattering outcrops,
etc. In still other places, middle Ordovician strata,
associated with other rocks, are highly folded, as in
the Appalachians, where such strata outcrop in only
narrow belts following the trend of the folds. In
short, then, wherever it can be proved that middle
Ordovician marine strata are visible at the surface,
or are concealed under other rocks, or were once
present, we can be sure that the middle Ordovician
sea existed. Exactly this principle applies to any

<p>The Ordovician period closed with a great mountain-making
disturbance in eastern North America,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">» 188 «</a></span>
and at the same time all, or nearly all, of the
continent was land. Throughout most of the Cambrian
and Ordovician periods, the strata accumulated
to a thickness of thousands of feet in the
marine waters which spread over the eastern border
of New York, the sites of the Green Mountains of
Vermont, the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts, and
southward at least as far as Virginia, over the area
of the Piedmont Plateau. At, or toward the close
of the Ordovician period, a great compressive force
in the earth&rsquo;s crust was brought to bear upon the
mass of strata and they were tilted, highly folded,
and raised above sea level into a great mountain
range known to geologists as the Taconic Range.
It is quite the rule throughout this region of Taconic
disturbance to find the strata either on edge or making
high angles with the plane of the horizon. Many
of the folds were actually overturned, and in some
cases notable thrust faults developed, that is, the
upper strata broke across and great masses were
shoved over each other. These facts all go to show
that the mountain-making compressive force applied
to the region was of rather an extreme type.
Since the origin of the Taconic Range a tremendous
amount of erosion has taken place, so that literally
only the roots of the range are now exposed in the
Green Mountains, Berkshire Hills, Highlands-of-the-Hudson,
and the northern Piedmont Plateau.</p>

<p>How do we know that the Taconic disturbance took
place toward the close of the Ordovician period? By
way of answer to this question two facts need to be
considered. First, relatively late (or young) Ordovician
strata are involved with the folds, thus
proving that the folds formed after those late Ordovician
sediments were deposited. Second, undisturbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">» 189 «</a></span>
strata formed during
the middle of the next
(Silurian) period, rest upon
the eroded edges of the
folds, which proves that
the folds must have developed
well before middle
Silurian time because the
only time they were subjected
to erosion must have
been during early Silurian
time.</p>

New York Museum Report.)</div>
</div>

<p>Mention should also be
made of the profound metamorphism
(alteration) of
the Cambrian and Ordovician
strata along the main
axis of the range, where the
intense compression, aided
by heat and moisture, caused
the deeply buried portions of
the strata to become plastic,
and hence they became more
or less foliated (cleavable)
and crystallized into various
metamorphic rock types, the
limestone having changed to
marble, the shale to slate or
schist, and the sandstone to
quartzite. Thus we explain
the rocks of the extensive
marble quarries of Vermont
and western Massachusetts,
the slate quarries of central
eastern New York, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">» 190 «</a></span>
the Berkshire schist of the Berkshire Hills of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>One of the grandest and most significant of all the
profound geological processes is the birth and history
of a great folded mountain range. Since the
Taconic Range affords us such an excellent example
of a large-scale, well-understood folded range of
great antiquity we may do well to consider it in the
light of certain other broad relationships. The
great compressive force which folded and upraised
the Taconic Mountains did not accomplish its work
rapidly in the ordinary human history sense of the
word. The force was slowly and irresistibly applied,
and the strata well below the surface were gradually
bulged or folded, or fractured where near the surface,
the length of time required for the operation
having been, at the very least calculation, some hundreds
of thousands of years, and more than likely a
million years or more. Such a length of time is, however,
so short compared with all known earth history,
that we are accustomed to refer to the formation
of such a mountain range as simply an event of
geological history.</p>

<p>Even before such a range attains its maximum
height a very considerable amount of erosion has already
taken place. When the first fold appears above
sea level, erosion begins its work and continues
with increasing vigor as the mountain masses get
higher and higher. Thus we have warfare between
two great natural processes&mdash;the building up and
the tearing down. After a time the building-up
process wanes and then ceases, while the tearing-down
process (erosion) continues either until the
whole range has been completely worn down or until
some rejuvenating force causes a renewed uplift.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">» 191 «</a></span>
Here is an example of one of the remarkable procedures
of nature. After millions of years of work
causing the deposition of thousands of feet of strata,
piled layer upon layer on the sea floor, a force of
lateral pressure is brought to bear and a mountain
range is literally born out of the sea. No sooner is
the range well formed than the destructive processes
(erosion) unceasingly set to work to destroy this
marvelous work. But the sediments derived from
the wear of the range are carried into the nearest
ocean again to accumulate and, perchance, after
long ages, to be raised into another range; and so
the process may be often repeated. From this we
learn that the mountain ranges of the earth are by
no means all of the same age. The original Adirondacks
were formed long before the Taconics, which
originated millions of years before the Appalachians,
these latter having been folded up long before
the Sierras. The Rockies, followed by the Coast
Ranges, are each younger than the Sierras as regards
their original folding and uplift. Among
foreign countries special mention should be made of
the British Isles, where Ordovician strata thousands
of feet thick were, late in the period, notably folded
and upraised, the crustal disturbance having been
accompanied by great intrusions of molten rocks
and vast outpourings of lavas, so that this region
ranks among the greatest of the ancient volcanic
areas of Europe.</p>

<p>We shall now turn our attention to a very brief
consideration of the salient points in the physical
history of North America during the next great
period (Silurian) of the Paleozoic era. As a result
of the physical disturbance late in the Ordovician
the great interior sea was largely or wholly
expelled from the continent, and this was essentially
the condition of the continent at the beginning
of the Silurian. But this condition was of short
duration, for early in the Silurian the sea again
began to spread, gradually increasing in extent to
a climax in about the middle of the period. At this
time the famous and extensive Niagara limestone,
so named from the rock at the crest of Niagara
Falls, was deposited. Except for the newly formed
Taconic Range, standing out as a bold topographic
feature along the middle Atlantic Coast, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">» 193 «</a></span>
somewhat wider extent of land, the condition of the
continent during middle Silurian time was very
similar to that of middle Ordovician time.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 337px;">
<a name="Fig_38" id="Fig_38"></a><img src="images/fig38.png" width="337" height="443" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span>&mdash;Map showing the general relations of land and water in
North America during middle Mississippian time. (After Willis, courtesy

</div>

<p>Soon after mid-Silurian time the seas became
greatly restricted almost to disappearance as such.
In the eastern United States and southeastern
Canada strata of that particular age are found only
in parts of Ontario, New York, Ohio, Michigan, and
from Pennsylvania southward to West Virginia,
where they are characterized by red shales and
sandstones, and salt and gypsum deposits. Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">» 194 «</a></span>
materials containing few fossils very clearly indicate
deposition in either extensive lagoons or more
or less cut-off arms of the sea under arid climate
conditions rather than in ordinary marine water.</p>

<p>Still later in the Silurian the interior seas were
partially restored, as shown by the fact that true
marine strata corresponding to that age not only
cover the salt and gypsum deposits, but are notably
more extensive than they. About the close of the
Silurian period almost all of the continent was
dry land.</p>

<p>Unlike the Ordovician period, the Silurian closed
without any mountain-making disturbance or great
uplift of land. The Silurian period, like the preceding
Ordovician and Cambrian, seems to have been
free from any more than slight igneous activity as,
for example, in Maine and New Brunswick. The
total thickness of Silurian strata in North America
is seldom more than a few thousand feet.</p>

<p>The salient features of the physical history of
the next, or Devonian period, are much like those
of the preceding Silurian. At the beginning of the
Devonian almost all of the continent was dry land,
but soon a long, narrow arm of the sea extended
across the eastern side of the continent from the
Gulf of St. Lawrence southward through western
New England, southeastern New York and throughout
the Appalachian district, thus reminding us of
the long, narrow sound which occupied almost exactly
the same territory during the early part of the
Cambrian period. In the west the only water was
a small embayment reaching across southern California
into Nevada. By middle Devonian time these
water areas had considerably expanded. During
relatively late Devonian time the sea was so expanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">» 195 «</a></span>
as to cover much of the Mississippi Valley
area, the Appalachian Mountains and St. Lawrence
Valley areas, and most of the site of the Rocky
Mountains, except for an island of considerable size
reaching from New Mexico through Wyoming. The
main lands were most of northeastern North America,
a large land area extending from Florida to
Nova Scotia, and a large area on the western side of
the continent from California to Alaska.</p>

<p>A remarkable formation of late Devonian Age
should be briefly described. In southeastern New
York and the northern Appalachian region there
was a tremendous accumulation of sediments which
have consolidated into sandstone, together with
some shale and conglomerate. This so-called &ldquo;Catskill&rdquo;
formation is from 1,500 to 8,000 feet thick and
is well shown as the main body of rock in the Catskill
Mountains. It is largely a shallow-water deposit
of essentially nonmarine origin, as proved
by coarseness of material, ripple marks, and nonmarine
fossils. All evidence points to the origin of
this remarkable formation as a great delta deposit
built out into the shallow interior sea. Notable
thinning toward the west, with increasing fineness
of grain of material, shows that the sediment came
from the east, no doubt carried by a large river from
the small continental land mass (called &ldquo;Appalachia&rdquo;)
on the eastern side of North America.</p>

<p>The maximum thickness of the North American
Devonian seems to be about 15,000 feet in the
northern Appalachian region, but elsewhere it generally
ranges from 1,000 to 4,000 feet thick. In
North America the subdivisions of the Devonian
strata of New York are taken as a standard for
comparison, both because of the wonderful completeness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">» 196 «</a></span>
and almost undisturbed character of the
rocks there, and because they have been so carefully
studied. The Devonian system is there fully
4,000 feet thick, with scarcely a minor subdivision
missing, and it covers a wide area (one-third of the
State) with many excellent outcrops. There was
practically uninterrupted deposition of Devonian
strata in southern New York. It is doubtful if
there is greater refinement of knowledge regarding
the Devonian or any other Paleozoic system of
strata anywhere else in North America.</p>

<p>During middle to late Devonian time the region
from southern New England to Nova Scotia and
the St. Lawrence Valley was notably disturbed by
earth movements, the lands having been considerably
elevated and the rocks more or less folded.
The great delta deposit of late Devonian time,
already described as being thousands of feet thick
in New York and Pennsylvania, was formed by one
or more streams which carved much sediment from
the newly upraised lands. Accompanying the uplift
and folding of the rocks considerable masses of molten
granite were forced into the earth&rsquo;s crust and
some molten rock was forced to the surface, producing
volcanoes. Much of the granite may now be seen
at the surface in various portions of the region,
while deeply eroded volcanoes occur near the city of
Montreal.</p>

<p>Except for the disturbance of the region from
New England to the St. Lawrence, the Devonian
period seems to have closed rather quietly, with
fairly widespread sea water over the land as already
outlined. This is proved by the fact that the early
strata of the next period mostly rest in regular
order upon the undisturbed late Devonian strata.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">» 197 «</a></span></p>

<p>For many years the term &ldquo;Carboniferous&rdquo; period
was used to designate a single period of geologic
time which, in America at least, is now divided into
two periods&mdash;the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian&mdash;corresponding,
respectively, to the earliest and
latest Carboniferous. In regard to the relations of
land and water during the Mississippian period, the
general statement may be made that the sea, already
fairly extensive in the late Devonian, continued to
spread until during the second half of the Mississippian,
when most of the United States west of the
eastern border of the Appalachians (except the
Pacific Northwest), and also the Rocky Mountain
region through Canada, were submerged.</p>

<p>A significant physical change marked the close of
the Mississippian. This was the withdrawal of sea
water from nearly all of the continent, the emergence
of the land having been generally sufficient to
allow considerable erosion. The fact that the Mississippian
and the next, or Pennsylvanian, strata
are separated by the most extensive distinct erosion
surface in the whole Paleozoic group of rocks is the
chief reason for considering those two sets of strata
to have formed during separate periods of geologic
time.</p>

<p>In eastern North America the Mississippian
strata vary in thickness from a few hundred feet
to a maximum of about 5,000 feet in eastern Pennsylvania.
In the West, where the thickness is commonly
several thousand feet, limestone greatly predominates.
There appears to have been vigorous
volcanic activity during the period from northern
California to Alaska.</p>

<p>Certain profound crustal disturbances marked the
close of the period in western Europe, resulting in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">» 198 «</a></span>
upturning and folding of rocks during the process
of mountain forming from Ireland to Germany,
and from Bohemia to southern France. Abundant
intrusions and extrusions of molten rocks accompanied
the disturbances.</p>

<p>We turn next to a consideration of the Pennsylvanian
period, which is of very special interest, because
within the rocks of that age in North America,
Europe, and China occur the greatest known coal
deposits. The period opened with almost all of
North America dry land undergoing more or less
erosion. Early in Pennsylvanian time marine water
began to overspread the western side of the continent,
especially most of the western two-thirds of
the area of the United States, where strata thousands
of feet thick piled up. The sea was most
widespread before the middle of the period, when the
relations of land and water were about as shown
by <a href="#Fig_39">Figure 39</a>.</p>

<p>Over the site of the Appalachians and most of the
eastern half of the Mississippi Valley area the land
either stood near sea level and was often swampy or
marshy, or at other times it was a little below sea
level, allowing tidewater to overspread the area.
Such conditions alternated repeatedly, usually more
or less locally, over different parts of the districts in
which the great coal mines of the east are located.
Under such conditions strata from 1,000 to 8,000
feet thick accumulated. Remarkable physical geography
of this kind resulted in the growth and
accumulation of vast quantities of vegetable matter
which has changed into the world&rsquo;s greatest coal
beds. Similar conditions prevailed over parts of
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Rhode Island,
where strata fully 13,000 feet thick accumulated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">» 199 «</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the most perfect resemblance to coal-forming
condition is that now found on such coastal
plains as that of southern Florida and the Dismal
Swamps of Virginia and North Carolina. Both of
these areas are very level, though with slight depressions
in which there is either standing water or
swamp condition. In both regions there is such general
interference with free drainage that there are
extensive areas of swamp, and in both there are
beds of vegetable accumulations. In each of these
areas there is a general absence of sediment and
therefore a marked variety of vegetable deposit. If
either of these areas were submerged beneath the
sea, the vegetable remains would be buried and a
further step made toward the formation of a coal
bed. Reelevation, making a coastal plain, would
permit the accumulation of another coal bed above
the first, and this process might be continued again
and again.&rdquo; (H. Ries.) But it is not necessary to
assume repeated oscillations of a swamp area up
and down as the only way of accounting for a succession
of coal beds one above another in a given
region, because a general, but intermittent, subsidence,
with possibly some upward movements,
would occasionally cause the prolific plant life of a
swamp to be killed, after which sediment would deposit
over the site. Shoaling of water by accumulation
of sediment would permit the development of
more swamp plant life.</p>

America during the Pennsylvanian period at least 10,000,000 years
ago. Lined areas represent land. (After Willis, courtesy of the Journal
of Geology.)</div>
</div>

<p>In most coal-mining districts there are at least
several coal beds, one above another. In Illinois
there are nine; in Pennsylvania at least twenty; in
Alabama, thirty-five; and in Nova Scotia seventy-six,
but not all are important commercially. Each
coal bed in such a region represents a swamp which
existed in Pennsylvanian time at least ten or twelve
million years ago, and in which there grew a luxuriant
vegetation. Many individual swamps of that
time were of wide extent. The famous Pittsburgh
bituminous coal bed represents probably the largest
one of all. It extends from western Pennsylvania
into parts of Ohio and West Virginia over an area
of fully 15,000 square miles. More than 6,000
square miles of it are being worked and the coal bed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">» 201 «</a></span>
averages seven feet in thickness over an area of
2,000 square miles. Among the various anthracite
coal beds of the same age in eastern Pennsylvania
the Mammoth bed is exceptionally thick,
reaching a maximum of fifty feet or more.</p>

<p>In order that the reader may not gain the impression
that coal beds make up a very considerable
bulk of the strata in coal-mining regions, we
should state that, on the average, coal actually
constitutes less than 2 per cent of the containing
strata.</p>

<p>Some idea of the tremendous length of the geologic
ages may be gained by a consideration of the
time which must reasonably be allowed for the
accumulation of so many coal beds and their containing
strata. It has been estimated that a luxuriant
growth of vegetation would produce 100 tons of
dried organic matter per hundred years. Compressed
to the specific gravity of coal (1.4) this
would form a layer less than two-thirds of an inch
deep on an acre. During the chemical alteration of
vegetable matter to coal about four-fifths of the
organic matter disappears in the form of gases. On
this basis, then, it would take about 10,000 years to
accumulate the vegetable matter represented in a
coal bed one foot thick. When we realize that the total
thickness of the coal beds of the Pennsylvanian
system of strata in the great mining regions is commonly
from 100 to 250 feet, we conclude that the
time they represent is from 1,000,000 to 2,500,000
years. It seems most reasonable that the time necessary
for the deposition of the containing strata
must have been at least as long. It is, therefore, a
fair conclusion that the Pennsylvanian period lasted
from 2,000,000 to 5,000,000 years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">» 202 «</a></span></p>

<p>That the climate of the great Coal Age was warm
(not tropical), very moist, and uniform, is borne
out by such facts as the following, according to D.
White: The succulent nature of the plants with
their spongy leaves indicates prolific growth in
moist, mild climate; lack of yearly rings of growth
points to lack of distinct seasons; as in the case of
many existing plants the aerial roots signify a
warm, moist climate; plants of to-day nearest like
the coal plants thrive best in warm, moist regions;
vegetable matter at present accumulates best in temperate
rather than tropical climates, because there
decay is not so rapid; and the remarkable uniformity
of climate over the earth is clearly indicated by
finding fossil plants of almost or exactly identical
types in rocks of Pennsylvanian Age from the Polar
regions to the Tropics. The more remarkable plants
of the great Coal Age time are described in the
chapter on the evolution of plants (<a href="#Plate_15a">Plate 15</a>).</p>

<p>During the last (Permian) period of the Paleozoic
era the marine waters of the west, and the
alternating shallow tidewater, swamps, and near
sea level lands of the east gradually gave way to dry
lands, so that by the close of the period marine
water covered only a small part of the Southwest
from Oklahoma across central Texas to southern
California and northwestern Mexico, where strata
as much as several thousand feet thick formed. In
the middle western part of the area of the United
States, especially from northern Texas to Nebraska
and Wyoming, the climate was arid and red strata
(so-called &ldquo;Red Beds&rdquo;), salt, and gypsum were extensively
deposited on land and in great salt lakes
or more or less cut-off arms of the sea. Strata commonly
from 2,000 to 7,000 feet thick were there deposited.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">» 203 «</a></span>
Similar conditions prevailed in parts of
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland,
where strata 8,000 feet thick accumulated. Over
the site of most of the Appalachians the coal swamp
conditions, with local sea incursions, continued from
the preceding period, as shown by the character of
the strata (1,000 feet thick) containing some coal.</p>

<p>Vigorous volcanic activity which, as already mentioned,
began in the Mississippian period from northern
California to Alaska continued not only through
the Pennsylvanian and Permian but also into the
early Mesozoic era, as shown by the great quantities
of volcanic materials associated with rocks of
those ages.</p>

<p>The Permian presents a puzzling combination of
climatic conditions which causes it to stand out
in marked contrast against the generally mild and
uniform climates of nearly all of preceding Paleozoic
time. Most remarkable of all are the records
of a great Ice Age during early Permian time. One
surprising fact is the widespread distribution of the
glacial deposits in both the north and south temperate
zones, and even well within the torrid zone.
They are perhaps most extensive and best known
in Australia, South Africa, India, and Brazil. Glacial
deposits almost certainly of the same age on smaller
scales occur in eastern Massachusetts, southern England,
eastern Russia and the Caucasus region. Although
the areas occupied by the Permian glaciers,
which in many cases must have been extensive ice
sheets, cannot be accurately delimited, it is, nevertheless,
quite certain that the ice was notably more
extensively developed than it was during the great
&ldquo;Ice Age&rdquo; of late (Quaternary) geologic time.
Another surprising fact is that certain of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">» 204 «</a></span>
glaciers must have come down to, or nearly to, sea
level, as shown by the direct association of marine
strata with glacial deposits. Thus, in southern Australia
at least eight beds of glacial materials (some
of them 100 to 200 feet thick) occur within true
marine strata 2,000 feet thick. A third remarkable
fact is that the Permian Ice Age, like the Quaternary
Ice Age, had interglacial epochs of relatively mild
climate, as proved by the occurrences of beds of coal
between certain of the layers of glacial materials
in Australia, South Africa, and Brazil.</p>

<p>During much of Permian time the climate was arid
over large areas as, for example, much of the western
interior of the United States, from Ireland to
central Germany, and in eastern Russia, as proved
by great deposits of salt, gypsum, and red sediments.
During late Permian time the greatest salt beds in
the world were deposited in northern Germany,
a well near Berlin having penetrated a practically
solid body of salt associated with certain potash
and magnesia salts to a depth of about 4,000 feet
without reaching the bottom.</p>

<p>The occurrence of some coal beds, especially in
the earlier Permian rocks shows that, temporarily
at least, climatic conditions must have favored
luxurious growths of coal-forming plants in South
Africa, Brazil, Australia, and our own Appalachian
district.</p>

<p>From the above facts we see that the Permian
represents a remarkable combination of very extensive
glaciation, widespread aridity, and warmth
and moisture favorable to prolific plant growth all
in a single period of geologic time.</p>

<p>The Permian period, and, therefore, the great
Paleozoic era, was brought to a close by one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">» 205 «</a></span>
most profound physical disturbances in the known
history of North America. This has been called
the Appalachian Revolution because at that time
the Appalachian Mountain range was born out of the
sea by folding and upheaval of the strata. In fact,
&ldquo;the Appalachian Revolution was one of the most
critical periods in the history of the earth, and may
have been the greatest of them all in its results.&rdquo;
(C. Schuchert). Mountains were brought forth in
all the continents, including Australia. All of the
mountains which were formed late in the Paleozoic
have since been profoundly affected by erosion, and
the only ones (e.g., Appalachians) which now show
considerable altitudes are those which have been
rejuvenated by relatively (geologically) recent earth
movements.</p>

<p>We shall now turn our attention to the origin of
the Appalachian Range. All through the vast time
(probably fully 20,000,000 years) of the Paleozoic
era a large land mass was remarkably persistent
along the eastern side of North America. This
land, which has been called &ldquo;Appalachia,&rdquo; had its
western boundary approximately along the eastern
border of the sites of the Appalachian Range and
the western part of New England. It extended east
of the present coast line at least to the border of
the continental shelf from 100 to 200 miles out.
Concerning the actual altitude and topography of
Appalachia we know little or nothing, but the tremendous
quantities of sediment derived from its
erosion show that it was high enough during nearly
all of its history to undergo vigorous erosion.</p>

<p>Barring certain minor oscillations of level, the
region just west of Appalachia was mostly occupied
by sea water throughout much of Paleozoic time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">» 206 «</a></span>
and sediments derived from the erosion of Appalachia
were laid down layer upon layer as strata upon
that sea bottom. In general, the coarsest and greatest
thickness of sediments accumulated relatively
near the land, while finer materials, in thinner
sheets, deposited well out over much of the eastern
Mississippi Valley area in the shallow seas
which were there so commonly present. By actual
measurement we know that the thickness of strata
deposited over the site of the Appalachians was at
least 25,000 feet. Since these latter strata are
mostly of comparatively shallow sea-water origin,
as proved by coarseness of grain of material, ripple
marks, fossil coral reefs, etc., we are forced to conclude
that this marginal sea bottom gradually sank
while the process of sedimentation was in progress.
Otherwise we cannot possibly explain the great pile
of strata of shallow water origin. The very weight
of accumulating strata may either have aided or
actually caused the sinking of the long, relatively
narrow trough.</p>

<p>Finally, toward the close of the Paleozoic era,
sinking of the marginal sea floor and deposition of
sediments gave way to a yielding of the earth&rsquo;s
crust by a great force of lateral compression, causing
the strata to be thrown into folds well below
the surface and more or less fractured in their
upper portion. Thus, along the eastern side of the
site of the great interior Paleozoic sea, the Appalachian
Mountains rose out of what for millions of
years had been a long, narrow, sinking sea floor.
There was more or less folding from the Gulf of
St. Lawrence to central Alabama. <a href="#Fig_24">Figure 24</a> diagrammatically
represents the principal stages in the
history of the Appalachian Range.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">» 207 «</a></span></p>

<p>While the most pronounced earth disturbance
occurred through the long Appalachian belt, the
whole eastern side of the continent was profoundly
affected. Thus the Mississippi Valley area east of
the Great Plains was considerably upraised never
again to be submerged except along the Gulf Coast,
and an eastern interior sea has never since overspread
the region which was repeatedly sea-covered
during Paleozoic time.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">W</span>HAT was the condition of North America during
the first or Triassic period of the Mesozoic
era, approximately 8 or 10 million years ago? As
a result of the Appalachian Revolution the sea was
excluded from all the land except along much of the
western side from southern California to parts of
Alaska. On this western side of the continent the
Appalachian Revolution had little or no effect and
the Permian conditions continued, essentially without
change through the Triassic. The Triassic
strata up to 4,000 feet thick are there of typical
marine origin. In British Columbia and Alaska
there was much igneous activity.</p>

<p>Throughout much of the Rocky Mountains and
Great Plains region of the western United States
there are extensive deposits of red sediments (so-called
&ldquo;Red Beds&rdquo;), containing layers of salt and
gypsum, from 200 to 1,000 or more feet thick. These
strata commonly rest in regular order on Permian
Red Beds, so that conditions of deposition of Permian
time continued through Triassic time, that is
continental deposits formed mostly in salt lakes,
fresh lakes, along stream courses, and on land in
part by the action of wind.</p>

</div>

<p>In the eastern half of North America there is no
record of accumulation of any marine strata whatever,
because, as a result of the Appalachian Revolution,
the land was brought well above sea level.
There was, however, deposition of a remarkable
series of nonmarine strata in several long, narrow,
troughlike depressions whose trend was parallel to,
and just east of, the main axis of the newly formed
Appalachian Range. These troughs lay between the
Appalachians and the very persistent old land mass
called Appalachia which we have already described.
The facts that these troughs are truly down-warps;
that they so perfectly follow the trend of the Appalachian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">» 210 «</a></span>
Mountain folds; and that the strata in them
are of late Triassic Age, make it certain that they
were formed by a great lateral pressure which must
have been a continuation of the Appalachian Revolution.
Thus the Appalachian Mountains continued
to grow well into the Triassic period, and, while the
Paleozoic strata were being folded, the surface of
old Appalachia (including part of the Taconic
Mountain region) was down-warped to form the
troughs in which the late Triassic strata accumulated.
One trough extended through the Connecticut
Valley; another (the largest) from southeastern
New York through northern New Jersey,
southeastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, and into
Virginia; while several smaller ones occurred in
Virginia and North Carolina.</p>

<p>The down-warps or troughlike basins were very
favorably situated for rapid accumulation of thick
sedimentary deposits because of their position just
between large, high land masses which were being
vigorously eroded. The sediments derived from the
erosion of the young Appalachians were especially
abundant because of the vigorous wearing down of
the newly formed high mountains. A thickness of
from 5,000 to fully 15,000 feet of mostly red sandstones
and shales accumulated in these down-warps,
the character and great thickness of the strata
strongly pointing to gradual down-warping as the
deposition of the sediments went on. It is often
stated that these strata were formed in estuaries,
but, in the northern areas, at least from Massachusetts
to Maryland, many of the layers show ripple
marks, sun cracks, rain-drop pits, fossil plants, and
fossil bones and tracks of land reptiles. Such strata
may well have formed in very shallow water, such
as river-flood plains or temporary lakes, where
changing conditions frequently allowed the surface
layers to lie exposed to the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">» 212 «</a></span></p>

<p>During the time of the accumulation of the late
Triassic strata in the down-warp basins there was
considerable igneous activity, as proved by the occurrence
of sheets of igneous rock within the body of
strata. In some cases true lava flows with cindery
tops were forced out on the surface and then buried
under later sediments, while in other cases the sheets
of molten rock were forced up either between the
strata or obliquely through them, thus proving their
intrusive character. As a result of subsequent erosion,
these very resistant lava masses often stand
out conspicuously as relief features. Perhaps the
most noteworthy example is the great layer of such
intrusive igneous rock, part of which outcrops for
seventy miles mostly as a bold cliff forming the famous
Palisades of the Hudson, near New York City.
During the process of cooling and solidification of the
molten mass there was contraction which expressed
itself by breaking the rock mass into great, crude,
nearly vertical columns, and hence the origin of the
name &ldquo;Palisades.&rdquo; The cliff character of the outcrop
is due to the fact that the lava is much more
resistant to erosion than the sandstone above and
below it. In the Connecticut Valley of Massachusetts
a layer of lava several hundred feet thick boldly
outcrops, forming the crest of the well-known Mount
Tom-Mount Holyoke Range.</p>

<p>The close of the Triassic period was marked by
enough uplift to leave the whole eastern two-thirds
of the continent dry land undergoing erosion. The
Triassic deposits of the Atlantic Coast are much
broken up into large fault blocks, and this faulting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">» 213 «</a></span>
probably took place as a result
of the crustal disturbances toward
the end of the period. In the west
the Triassic conditions seem to have
continued without much change into
the next (or Jurassic) period.</p>

<p>During the Jurassic period the
relations of land and water in North
America were very simple. In the
earlier Jurassic all was dry land except
portions of the western fringe
of the continent from southern
California to Alaska, where marine
strata 2,000 to 10,000 feet thick
accumulated. Late in the period
the conditions were the same, except
for a long, narrow arm of the
sea or mediterranean which extended
from the Arctic Ocean southward
across the site of the Rocky
Mountains to Arizona. There is no
evidence for the existence of anything
like real mountains anywhere
on the continent during the period.</p>

</div>

<p>Profound crustal disturbances
marked the close of the Jurassic
period in the western part of the
continent. Strata which had accumulated
to great thickness during
millions of years of time, mainly
over the sites of the Sierra Nevada
and Cascade Mountains, finally
yielded to a tremendous force of
lateral compression, especially in
the Sierra region, and were folded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">» 214 «</a></span>
crumpled, and upraised. Thus the Sierra-Cascade
district was originally built up into a high mountain
range. Since that time the Sierras have been much
cut down by erosion and they have been rejuvenated
by faulting and tilting of the great earth block. The
Cascade Range from northern California into
British Columbia was apparently not so profoundly
raised, and its present height is mainly due to subsequent
volcanic activity. The rocks of the Klamath
Mountains of northwestern California, and of the
Humboldt Range of Nevada, were also folded at
that time.</p>

<p>During the mountain-making disturbances on the
western side of the continent great quantities of
molten granite were forced up into the lower portions
of the folding strata. Because of profound
subsequent erosion this granite is now widely exposed
as, for example, in the great walls of the
Yosemite Valley.</p>

<p>During the earlier half of the last period (the
Cretaceous) of the Mesozoic era, sea water spread
from Mississippi northwestward to the site of
Denver and southward over Texas and much of
Mexico. At the same time much of the western
margin of the continent from Alaska to California
was submerged. All the rest of the continent was
land. During this time sediments accumulated on
low lands just east of the site of the present Rocky
Mountains, and also east of the Appalachians, as
proved by the numerous fossils of land plants found
in these deposits.</p>

<p>As Cretaceous time went on the marine waters
gradually spread until the whole Atlantic and Gulf
coastal plain regions from Long Island, New York,
to Mexico became submerged under marine water,
and a wide arm of the sea, or great mediterranean,
spread from Texas north to the mouth of the Mackenzie
River. The Gulf of Mexico was thus directly
connected with the Arctic Ocean. This great interior
sea was nowhere connected with the Pacific
Ocean, though portions of the Pacific border of the
continent were submerged. This vast interior sea
was not only the largest of any which reached well
into the continent since the Mississippian period of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">» 216 «</a></span>
the Paleozoic era, but it was the last body of marine
water which ever extended well into the continent.
It should be stated that the later Cretaceous was also
a time of unusually widespread submergence of the
continents, when most of southern Europe and
southeastern Asia, as well as about one-half of both
Africa and South America were submerged. Over
much of the site of the Rocky Mountains during the
late Cretaceous there were low lands receiving continental
deposits, and extensive marshes supporting
prolific vegetation were common. Much of this
vegetable matter became buried, and has since been
converted into workable coal.</p>

<p>The maximum thickness of strata accumulated
during all of Cretaceous time over the Atlantic
coastal plain area was about 1,700 feet; over the
Gulf coastal plain region fully 7,500 feet; over the
western interior 10,000 to 15,000; and over parts
of the Pacific border 25,000 to 30,000 feet, as in California.
The last-named figures are truly phenomenal,
representing a thickness about equal to the
total thickness of all the strata accumulated during
the whole Paleozoic era (seven periods) and piled up
in the Appalachian Mountain region. This great
deposit of strata of mostly early Cretaceous Age
is readily accounted for when we realize that
these sediments, which accumulated in the marginal
sea bottom, were derived from the very
rapidly eroding, newly formed lofty Sierra Nevada
Range.</p>

<p>Especially in Alabama and Texas the Cretaceous
system is remarkable for its richness in chalk deposits.
In Alabama a widespread formation of late
Cretaceous Age, about 1,000 feet thick, contains
much nearly pure white chalk, and in Texas a similarly
constituted formation of early middle Cretaceous
Age is from 1,000 to 5,000 feet thick. These
chalk deposits consist almost wholly of carbonate
of lime shells or very tiny single-celled animals
which accumulated under exceptionally clear sea
water which spread over those parts of Alabama
and Texas where the chalk now occurs. Here again
we have a bit of evidence supporting the fact of
very long geologic time. Think of how long it must
have taken for the tiny (even microscopic) shells
to form a widespread layer of chalk nearly a mile
thick!</p>

<p>The close of the Cretaceous period, or what is the
same, the close of the Mesozoic era, was marked
by some of the grandest crustal disturbances in the
known history of the earth. In fact, it is not known
that the western hemisphere was ever affected by
more profound and widespread mountain-making
disturbances than those which took place toward
the close of the Mesozoic era, and continued into
the succeeding Tertiary period. These disturbances
were of three kinds: folding of strata, volcanic
activity, and renewed uplift of old mountains without
folding of the rocks. Greatest of all was the
&ldquo;Rocky Mountain Revolution,&rdquo; during which the
thick strata, which accumulated during the Paleozoic
and Mesozoic eras over the site of the Rockies,
yielded to vigorous deformation when they were
more or less folded and dislocated from Alaska to
Central America. This was in truth the birth of
the Rocky Mountains, although their existing altitude
and configuration have, to a very considerable
degree, resulted from later uplift and erosion. In
the northern United States and southern Canada the
Rocky Mountain strata, up to over 40,000 feet thick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">» 219 «</a></span>
were most severely folded and fractured, forming
a range which quite certainly was fully 20,000 feet
high. In this district a great thrust fault, hundreds
of miles long, developed, and rocks as old as the
Proterozoic were shoved at least seven miles, and
probably as much as twenty miles, westward, over
Cretaceous and other rocks much later than the
Proterozoic. At the same time the Andes Mountains
throughout South America were notably upraised
and the rocks folded.</p>

<p>The second type of physical disturbance was
volcanic activity which took place on a tremendous
scale, and which appears to have started as a direct
accompaniment of the Rocky Mountain Revolution.
This igneous activity took place not only in the
Rocky Mountains but also westward to and in the
Sierra-Cascade Range, as well as in the mountains
of western British Columbia and Alaska. This
activity continued well into the succeeding Cenozoic
era, and it is more fully considered in the next
chapter.</p>

<p>The third type of crustal disturbance took place
on a large scale when the Appalachian Mountains,
which had been almost wholly planed away by
erosion during Mesozoic time, were reelevated
from 1,000 to 3,000 feet by an uplifting force not
accompanied by folding. All or nearly all of New
York and New England, as well as much of southeastern
Canada, were similarly upraised at the same
time. This notable uplift of so much of eastern
North America is a matter of great importance because
the major relief features of that area have
been produced by erosion or dissection of the upraised
surface since late Mesozoic or early Cenozoic
time. In view of the fact that this work of erosion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">» 220 «</a></span>
took place almost wholly during the Cenozoic era, it
will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>

<p>In conclusion, brief mention may be made of the
kind of climate of the Mesozoic era. As shown by
the character and distribution of fossil plants and
animals, the Mesozoic climate was in general mild
and rather uniform over the earth, but with some
distinction of climatic zones. Such distinction of
climatic zones is unknown for the Paleozoic era,
while it was notably less than at present.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">S</span>INCE the Cenozoic era is the last one of geologic
time, it will be of particular interest to trace
out the main events which have led up to the present
day conditions, especially in North America. Both
because of the recency of the time and the unusual
accessibility of the rocks, which are mostly at or
near the surface, our knowledge of the Cenozoic era
is exceptionally detailed and accurate. It will,
therefore, be more necessary than ever to select
only the very significant features of this history for
our brief discussion.</p>

<p>During the first half of the Tertiary period portions
only of the Atlantic coastal plain were submerged
under shallow water, but soon after the
middle of the period (Miocene epoch) the sea
spread over practically the whole Atlantic coastal
plain area from Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard south to and
including Florida. During the late Tertiary the
marine waters had become greatly restricted, and
by the close of the period the sea was entirely excluded
from the Atlantic seaboard. The total thickness
of these Tertiary strata is less than 1,000 feet,
and they all tilt downward gently toward the sea.
The strata consist mostly of unconsolidated sands,
gravels, clays, marls, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">» 222 «</a></span></p>

<p>The Gulf coastal plain area from Florida through
Texas and south through eastern Mexico was largely
overspread by the sea during most of Tertiary time,
except the latest. During early Tertiary time an
arm of the Gulf reached north to the mouth of the
Ohio River. Late in the period but little of the
Gulf Plain was submerged, and at its close sea water
was wholly excluded. On the Gulf Coast the Tertiary
strata from 2,000 to 4,000 feet thick are also
mainly sands, gravels, clays, and marls. They are
commonly rich in fossils, and they show a gentle
tilt downward toward the Gulf.</p>

<p>Throughout Tertiary time local portions of the
Pacific border of the continent were submerged,
this having been especially true of portions of California,
Oregon, and Washington. In spite of the
very restricted marine waters, the Tertiary strata
of the Pacific Coast, especially in California, are
remarkably thick, 10,000 to 20,000 feet being common,
while the maximum thickness is fully 30,000
feet. Such great thicknesses are readily explained
when we realize that erosion was notably speeded
up by pronounced uplifts resulting from crustal
disturbances toward the close of the preceding
period, and again in the midst of the Tertiary
period itself.</p>

<p>To summarize the Tertiary relations of sea and
land for North America we may say that only local
portions of the continental border ever became submerged,
and that, by late Tertiary time, practically
the whole continent was a land area. At the close
of the period the continent was, as we shall see,
even larger than now because the continental
shelves of the ocean were then also largely above
water.</p>

</div>

<p>The whole of the Cenozoic era, including both the
Tertiary and Quaternary periods, has been a time
of profound crustal disturbances throughout much
of the continent, certain of these movements having
continued right up to the present time, with positive
evidence that some of them are still continuing.
These great movements have included notable foldings
of strata, uplifts without folding, faulting, and
igneous activity, the whole effect having been to
greatly increase the general altitude and ruggedness
of the continent. In fact, North America is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">» 224 «</a></span>
known ever to have been at once higher, broader,
and more rugged than it was very late in the Tertiary,
or early in the Quaternary, period. Since
that time the only notable change (barring the great
Ice Age and its effects) has been a restriction of
the area of the continent to its present size by
spreading of sea waters over the borders of the
continent, that is over the continental shelves.</p>

<p>We shall now rather systematically consider the
more profound earth changes which have affected
the continent, producing the existing major relief
features, from west to east.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Coast Range Revolution&rdquo; took place in the
midst of the Tertiary period. Over the site of the
Coast Ranges, strata had accumulated, especially
during Cretaceous and earlier Tertiary times, to a
thickness of thousands of feet. In middle Tertiary
time these strata were subjected to a mountain-making
force of compression and more or less
folded, faulted (fractured), and uplifted into the
Coast Range Mountains. Some portions of the
range were intensely folded and faulted and upraised
many thousands of feet, while other portions
were only moderately folded and uplifted. It is an
interesting fact that the great San Francisco earthquake
rift or fault originated at this time. It was
a renewed, sudden movement of a few feet along
this fault which caused the disastrous earthquake
of 1906. Still other considerable earth movements
took place in the Coast Range region during late
Tertiary and Quaternary times, as, for example,
uplift without folding, as proved by distinct sea-cut
terraces at altitudes of more than a thousand feet,
like those north of San Francisco and south of Los
Angeles. A moderate amount of still later subsidence
has caused the development of San Francisco
Bay. The large islands off the coast of southern
California have in very recent geologic time
(probably Quaternary) been cut off from the mainland
by sinking of the land.</p>

<p>The Sierra Nevada Range, which originated by
intense folding of rocks late in the Jurassic period,
underwent profound erosion until about the middle
of the Tertiary period, by which time it had been
cut down to a range of hills or low mountains. Then
the great fault (fracture) previously described
began to develop along the eastern side. As a result
of many sudden movements along this fault, which
is hundreds of miles long, the vast earth block has
been tilted westward with a very steep eastern face
and a long, more gradual western slope, the crest
of the fault block forming the summit of the range.
The amount of nearly vertical displacement along
this fault has been commonly from 10,000 to 20,000
feet, and, in spite of considerable erosion of the top
of the fault block and accumulation of sediment at
its eastern base, the modified fault face now usually
stands out boldly from 2,000 to 10,000 feet high.
As an evidence that this movement of faulting has
not yet ceased we may cite the Inyo earthquake of
1872, when there was a sudden renewal of movement
of ten to twenty-five feet along this fault
for many miles. Since the great Sierra block began
to tilt, the many mighty canyons, like Yosemite,
Hetch-Hetchy, King&rsquo;s River, and Feather River,
have been carved out by the action of streams, in
some cases aided by former glaciers. King&rsquo;s River
canyon has been sunk to a maximum depth of
6,900 feet in solid granite solely by the erosive
action of the river!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">» 226 «</a></span></p>

<p>The Cascade Mountains, too, were reduced to
nearly a peneplain condition by late Tertiary time
when they began to be rejuvenated by arching or
bowing of the surface unaccompanied by great
faulting or fracturing, and many canyons, like that
of the Columbia River, have since been carved out.</p>

<p>Mention should now be made of the vigorous volcanic
activity which took place in the Cascade and
Sierra Nevada Ranges. Most of this activity occurred
during Tertiary time (particularly in the
latter part) and it has continued with diminishing
force practically to the present time. In California
streams of lava buried many gold-bearing river
gravels which have yielded rich mines. Many well-known
mountain peaks, such as Shasta, Lassen, Pitt,
Hood, and Rainier, from northern California to
Washington, are great volcanic cones which date
from Tertiary time, and which are now mostly inactive.
That this volcanic activity has not yet
altogether ceased is shown by renewed eruptions of
Mount Lassen (or Lassen Peak, altitude 10,437
feet) in northern California. Since the beginning
of this renewed activity in 1914, several hundred
outbursts have occurred. No molten rock has
flowed out, but large quantities of rock fragments,
dust and steam have been erupted, in many cases
forming great clouds two or three miles high over
the top of the mountain (<a href="#Plate_10a">Plate 10</a>). At this writing
(October, 1920), Mount Lassen is still showing
vigorous activity. At Cinder Cone, only ten miles
from Mount Lassen, there were two eruptions of
cinders and a considerable outpouring of lava
within the last 200 years. Still other very recent
cinder cones occur in southeastern California and
Arizona.</p>

<p>One of the greatest lava fields in the world forms
the Columbian Plateau between western Wyoming
(including the Yellowstone National Park) and the
Cascade Mountains from northeastern California
to northern Washington. It covers fully 200,000
square miles and is really considerably larger than
shown on the map because the lava in parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">» 228 «</a></span>
plateau region are covered by very recent sedimentary
materials.</p>

<p>The great lava fields of the Deccan, India, and of
the plateau region of western Mexico are comparable
in size to the Columbian field and these lava
fields are all of the same age. In the Columbian
Plateau most of the lava was poured out during
later Tertiary time. Sheets of molten rock, averaging
fifty to one hundred feet in thickness, spread
out over various parts of the region and piled up by
overlapping layers one over another until the lava
plateau more than a mile high was built up. Many
hills and low mountains were completely buried
under the molten floods, and in other places the
liquid rock masses flowed against the higher mountains.
&ldquo;For thousands of square miles the surface
is a lava plain which meets the boundary mountains
as a lake or sea meets a rugged and deeply indented
coast.... The plateau was long in building.
Between the layers are found in places old soil beds
and forest grounds and the sediments of lakes....
So ancient are the latest floods in the Columbia River
Basin that they have weathered to a residual yellow
clay from thirty to sixty feet in depth, and marvelously
rich in the mineral substances on which
plants feed. In the Snake River Valley the latest
lavas are much younger (Quaternary). Their
surfaces are so fresh and undecayed that here the
effusive eruptions may have continued to within the
period of human history.&rdquo; (W. H. Norton.) Many
of the lava layers are plainly visible where the
Columbia River has cut its great gorge or canyon.
The Snake River in places has sunk its channel
several thousand feet into the lava plateau without
reaching underlying rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">» 229 «</a></span></p>

<p>Both north and south of the Columbian Plateau
there was also much volcanic activity in the Rocky
Mountain region during Tertiary time. A single
formation in Colorado consists mostly of volcanic
&ldquo;ash&rdquo; or dust over 2,000 feet thick. There was
also much volcanic activity over the Colorado
Plateau area of southern Utah, New Mexico, and
Arizona. The volcanoes there exhibit all stages
from those which are very recent and practically
unaffected by erosion to others which have been
completely cut away with the exception of the cores
or &ldquo;volcanic necks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the second half of the Tertiary period
the whole region known as the Great Basin, between
the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and
the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, began to be affected
by profound faulting or fracturing and tilting of
portions of the earth&rsquo;s crust. The two largest
faults, one on the western side of the Wasatch
Range and the other on the eastern side of the
Sierra Range, are each hundreds of miles long.
Each of these ranges owes most of its present altitude
to the uptilting of great fault blocks, and most
of the many nearly north-south Basin Ranges of
Nevada and Utah are in reality recently tilted fault
blocks.</p>

<p>Turning now to the Colorado Plateau, studies
have shown that region to have been more or less
periodically raised fully 20,000 feet since the beginning
of Tertiary time, but because of profound
erosion in the meantime its present altitude is only
6,000 to 9,000 feet. During late Tertiary time the
land stood at a much lower level than to-day, so
that, practically during the last period (Quaternary)
of geologic time, the region has been elevated to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">» 230 «</a></span>
present position. As a direct result of this profound
rejuvenation the Colorado River has had its
erosive activity tremendously increased, and it has
carved out the mightiest of all existing canyons&mdash;the
Grand Canyon. The work of deepening and
widening the canyon is still proceeding at a rapid
geologic rate.</p>

<p>As we have learned, the Rocky Mountains and
many of its subsidiary ranges were formed by folding
and uplift of strata toward the close of the
Mesozoic era (Cretaceous period). During much of
Tertiary time the newly formed mountains had
been considerably reduced by erosion. Then, late
in the Tertiary period, much of the Rocky Mountain
region, as well as much of the Great Plains area
just east of the mountains, became rejuvenated by
differential uplift without any notable folding of
strata. We can tell that this general uplift
amounted to at least several thousand feet because
definite formations of relatively late Tertiary
strata, originally horizontally deposited under inland
bodies of water, gradually rise so that at the
base of the Front Range of the Rockies they are
fully 3,000 feet higher than they are 200 miles or
more farther east. Thus, the original folding and
faulting of the Rockies, Tertiary volcanic activity,
late Tertiary rejuvenation, and subsequent erosion
account for the present altitude and relief features
of the great Rocky Mountain system.</p>

<p>Portions of the rejuvenated Great Plains region
have been notably dissected by erosion since the late
Tertiary, this being particularly true of the so-called
&ldquo;Bad Lands,&rdquo; especially in parts of Wyoming and
South Dakota, where mostly relatively soft Tertiary
strata have been cut to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">» 231 «</a></span></p>

<p>Turning our attention now to the eastern half of
the continent we find that all, or nearly all, of it
was more or less raised toward the close of the
Tertiary period. Practically the whole Mississippi
Valley east of the Great Plains, as well as much of
the country to the north in Canada, was elevated
some hundreds of feet and the streams have since
the late Tertiary uplift (except where the land
was ice-covered during the Ice Age) been at work
sinking their channels below the newly upraised
surface.</p>

<p>As already pointed out, the lowlands of the Atlantic
and Gulf Coastal Plains were mostly submerged
under the sea during early middle Tertiary time. By
the close of the period they had emerged practically
to their present positions, and they have been only
moderately affected by erosion.</p>

<p>We have still to explain the existing topography
or relief of a large and important part of eastern
North America, including the whole of the Appalachian
Mountains, Allegheny Plateau, Piedmont
Plateau, New York, New England, and the
Canadian region to the north. As a starting point
in this discussion we should recall the fact that,
after the great Appalachian Mountain Revolution
toward the close of the Paleozoic era, the predominant
geologic process which affected the region
under consideration was erosion throughout the
succeeding Mesozoic era. By about the close of the
Mesozoic (Cretaceous period) the whole region,
with some local exceptions, has been worn down to
a comparatively smooth plain (peneplain) not far
above sea level. Local exceptions were mainly in
the New York and New England region as, for
example, some of the higher parts of the Adirondack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">» 232 «</a></span>
and White Mountains, Mount Monadnock in
southern New Hampshire, and Mount Greylock in
western Massachusetts. These and other masses
rose rather conspicuously above the general level
of the great plain of erosion commonly called the
&ldquo;Cretaceous peneplain&rdquo; because it is believed to
have been well developed by the close of that period.</p>

<p>The uplift of the vast Cretaceous peneplain about
the beginning of the Cenozoic era (Tertiary period)
was an event of prime importance in the recent geological
history of eastern North America because it
was literally the initial step in bringing about nearly
all of the existing major relief features of the
Appalachian-New York-New England-St. Lawrence
region. The amount of uplift (unaccompanied by
folding) of the peneplain was commonly from a few
hundred to a few thousand feet with the greatest
amount in general along the main trend of the
Appalachians. The fact should be emphasized that
nearly all the principal topographic features of the
great upraised region have been produced by dissection
(erosion) of the uplifted peneplain surface.
Thus nearly all the valleys, small and large, including
those of the St. Lawrence, Hudson, Mohawk,
Connecticut, and Susquehanna, have been carved
out by streams since the uplift of the great peneplain.</p>

<p>The streams which flowed upon the old low-lying
peneplain surface meandered sluggishly over deep
alluvial or flood-plain deposits, and their courses
were little if any determined by the character and
structure of the underlying rocks, because, with few
exceptions, all rocks were worn down to the general
plain level. The uplift of the peneplain, however,
caused great revival of activity of erosive power by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">» 233 «</a></span>
the streams, the larger ones of which soon cut
through the loose superficial alluvial deposits and
then into the underlying bedrock. Thus the large,
original streams had their courses well determined
in the overlying deposits, and when the underlying
rocks were reached the same courses had to be
pursued entirely without reference to the underlying
rock character and structure. Such streams are
said to be &ldquo;superimposed&rdquo; because they have, so to
speak, been let down upon and into the underlying
rock masses. As Professor Berkey has well said:
&ldquo;The larger rivers, the great master streams, of the
superimposed drainage system, in some cases were
so efficient in the corrosion of their channels that
the discovery of discordant structures (in the underlying
rocks) has not been of sufficient influence
to displace them, or reverse them, or even to shift
them very far from their original direct course to
the sea. They cut directly across mountain ridges
because they flowed over the plain out of which
these ridges have been carved, and because their
own erosive and transporting power have exceeded
those of any of their tributaries or neighbors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fine examples of such superimposed streams
which are now entirely out of harmony with the
structure of regions through which they flow are
the Susquehanna, Delaware, and Hudson. Thus the
Susquehanna cuts across a whole succession of Appalachian
ridges while, in accordance with the same
explanation, the Delaware cuts through the Kittatiny
range or ridge at the famous Delaware
Water Gap. The ridges are explained as follows:
while the great master streams were cutting deep
trenches or channels in hard and soft rock alike,
numerous side streams (tributaries) came into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">» 234 «</a></span>
existence and naturally mostly developed along
belts of weak, easily eroded rock parallel to geologic
(folded) structure. Thus the Appalachian
valleys have been, and are being, formed, while the
ridges represent the more resistant rock formations
which have more effectually stood out against
erosion. The lower Hudson River flows at a considerable
angle across folded formations above the
Highlands, after which it passes though a deep
gorge which it has cut into the hard granite and
other rocks of the Highlands. The simple explanation
is that the Hudson had its course determined
upon the surface of the upraised Cretaceous peneplain,
and that it has been able to keep that course
in spite of discordant structure and character of the
underlying rocks. In a similar manner we may
readily account for the passage of the Connecticut
River through a great gap in the Holyoke ridge or
range of hard lava in western Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Before leaving this part of our discussion we shall
briefly present some evidence showing that the New
York-New England-St. Lawrence region at least
must have been considerably higher shortly before
the Ice Age (Quaternary period). An old channel
of the Hudson River has been traced about 100 miles
eastward beyond the present mouth of the river
and it forms a distinct trench under the shallow
sea in the continental shelf. Even in the Hudson
Valley, many miles above New York City, the bedrock
bottom of the river lies hundreds of feet (near
West Point, 800 feet) below sea level. Obviously
this submerged channel must have been cut when
the land in the general vicinity of New York City
was fully 1,000 feet higher than at present. That
the land thus stood higher late in the Tertiary and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">» 235 «</a></span>
possibly early in the Quaternary periods is proved
as follows: (1) because most of Tertiary time must
have been needed for the river to erode such a deep
valley after the initial uplift of the peneplain about
the beginning of the period; and (2) because glacial
deposits of Quaternary age filled the former
channel to a considerable depth. The valleys of
the coast of Maine, and the submerged lower St.
Lawrence Valley (Gulf of St. Lawrence), in a
similar way lead us to conclude that the region
farther north was also notably higher just before
the Ice Age.</p>

<p>In the eastern hemisphere early in the Tertiary
period a great submergence set in and marine
waters spread over much of western and southern
Europe, northern Africa, and southern Asia. The
sites of the Himalayas, Alps, Pyrenees, Apennines
and other mountains were then mostly submerged.
A very remarkable marine deposit, made up almost
wholly of carbonate of lime shells of a single-celled
animal called Nummulites, formed on the floor of
this vastly expanded early Tertiary mediterranean.
This rock attains a thickness of several thousand
feet. It is doubtful if any other single formation
made up almost entirely of the shells of but one
species is at once so widespread and thick. In the
Alps this remarkable marine deposit may be seen
10,000 feet above sea level, and in Tibet fully 20,000
feet. Much of the rock in the Egyptian pyramids
was quarried from this formation.</p>

<p>Later in the Tertiary in Eurasia and Africa the
marine waters gradually became very restricted, so
that by the close of the period the relations of land
and sea were not strikingly different from the
present, although northwestern Europe, like northeastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">» 236 «</a></span>
North America, was notably higher just
before the Ice Age than it is to-day.</p>

<p>Eurasia witnessed tremendous crustal disturbances
during the middle and later Tertiary time
when, due to intense folding and uplift of great
zones, the Himalayas, Caucasus, Alps, Pyrenees,
Apennines, and other great ranges were formed.
The crustal disturbance was most remarkable in
the region of the Alps, where the movement resulted
in &ldquo;elevating and folding the Tertiary and older
strata into overturned, recumbent, and nearly horizontal
folds, and pushing the southern or Lepontine
Alps about sixty miles (over a low angle fault
fracture) to the northward into the Helvetic region.
Erosion has since carved up these overthrust sheets,
leaving remnants lying on foundations which belong
to a more northern portion of the ancient (early
Tertiary) sea. Most noted of these residuals of
overthrust masses is the Matterhorn, a mighty
mountain without roots, a stranger in a foreign
geologic environment.&rdquo; (C. Schuchert.)</p>

<p>The last period of geological time&mdash;the Quaternary&mdash;was
ushered in by the spreading of vast
sheets of ice over much of northern North America
and northern Europe, and this ranks among the
most interesting and remarkable events of known
geological time. On first thought the former existence
of such vast ice sheets seems unbelievable, but
the Ice Age occurred so short a time ago that the
records of the event are perfectly clear and conclusive.
The fact of this great Ice Age was discovered
by Louis Agassiz in 1837, and fully announced
before the British Scientific Association in 1840.
For some years the idea was opposed, especially by
advocates of the so-called iceberg theory. Now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">» 237 «</a></span>
however, no important event of earth history is
more firmly established, and no student of the subject
ever questions the fact of the Quaternary Ice
Age.</p>

<p>Some of the proofs of the former presence of the
great ice sheet are as follows: (1) polished and
striated rock surfaces which are precisely like those
produced by existing glaciers, and which could not
possibly have been produced by any other agency;
(2) glacial bowlders or &ldquo;erratics&rdquo; which are often
somewhat rounded and scratched, and which have
often been transported many miles from their
parent rock ledges (<a href="#Plate_20a">Plate 20</a>); (3) true glacial
moraines, especially terminal moraines, like that
which extends the full length of Long Island and
marks the southernmost limit of the great ice sheet;
and (4) the generally widespread distribution over
most of the glaciated area of heterogeneous glacial
débris, both unstratified and stratified, which is
clearly transported material and typically rests
upon the bedrock by sharp contact.</p>

<p>The best known existing great ice sheets are those
of Greenland and Antarctica, especially the former,
which covers about 500,000 square miles. This
glacier is so large and deep that only an occasional
high rocky mountain projects above its surface, and
the ice is known to be slowly moving outward in all
directions from the interior to the margins of
Greenland. Along the margins, where melting is
more rapid, some land is exposed, and often the ice
flows out into the ocean where it breaks off to form
large icebergs.</p>

during the Great Ice Age of the Quaternary period; the three great
glacial centers; and the extent of mountain glaciers in the west. (After
U. S. Geological Survey.)</div>
</div>

<p>The accompanying map shows the area of nearly
4,000,000 square miles of North America covered
by ice at the time of maximum glaciation, and also
the three great centers of accumulation and dispersal
of the ice. The directions of flow from these
centers have been determined by the study of the
directions of many thousands of glacial scratches
on rock ledges. The Labradorean (or Laurentide)
glacier spread out 1,600 miles to the south to Long
Island and near the mouth of the Ohio River. The
vast Keewatin glacier sent a great lobe of ice nearly
as far south, that is into northern Missouri. "One
of the most marvelous features of the ice dispersion
was the great extension of the Keewatin sheet from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">» 239 «</a></span>
a low flat center westward and southward over what
is now a semiarid plain, rising in the direction in
which the ice moved, while the mountain glaciers
on the west (Cordilleran region), where now
known, pushed eastward but little beyond the foot-hills."
(Chamberlin and Salisbury.)</p>

<p>The Labradorean and Keewatin ice sheets everywhere
coalesced except in two places. One of these
is an area of about 10,000 square miles mostly in
southwestern Wisconsin. In spite of several ice invasions
during the Ice Age, this area, hundreds of
miles north of the southern limit of the ice sheets,
was never ice-covered. There is a total absence of
records of glaciation within this area, and so we
here have an excellent sample of the kind of topography
which prevailed over the northern Mississippi
Valley just before the advent of the ice. A much
smaller, nonglaciated area occurs in northeastern
Missouri near the southern limit of ice extension.</p>

<p>The Cordilleran ice sheet was the smallest of the
three, and it was probably not such a continuous
mass of ice, the higher mountains projecting above
its surface. A surprising fact is that neither this
ice sheet nor any other overspread northern Alaska,
which is well within the Arctic Circle, during the Ice
Age. More than likely the temperature was low
enough, but precipitation of snow was not sufficient
to permit the building up of a great glacier.</p>

<p>At the same time that nearly 4,000,000 square
miles of North America were ice-covered, about
600,000 square miles of northern Europe were
buried under ice which spread from the one great
center over Scandinavia southwest, south, and
southeast over most of the British Isles, well into
Germany, and well into Russia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">» 240 «</a></span></p>

<p>In both North America and Europe the high
mountains, well south of the great glacier limits,
especially the Sierras, Rockies, Alps, Pyrenees, and
Caucasus, supported many large local glaciers in
valleys which now contain none at all or only relatively
small ones.</p>

<p>Records of glaciation, such as glacial scratches,
bowlders, lakes, etc., occur high up in the White and
Green Mountains, Adirondacks, Catskills, and the
Berkshire Hills, thus proving that the ice must have
been at least some thousands of feet thick over New
England and New York. We have good reason to
believe that even the highest summits, except possibly
in the Catskills, from 4,000 to over 6,000 feet
above sea level, were completely submerged under
the ice. On top of a mountain of Archeozoic granite
nearly 4,000 feet in altitude, facing the St. Lawrence
Valley in northern New York, the writer has found
many fragments of sandstone which were picked
off by the ice in the low valley, moved southward a
good many miles, and uphill several thousand feet
to the top of the mountain. The reader may wonder
how a great glacier at least a mile thick in northern
New York could have thinned out to disappearance
within the short distance to the southern border of
the State, but observations on existing large glaciers
show that it is quite the habit for them to thin out
very rapidly near their margins, thus producing
steep ice fronts.</p>

<p>The fact that glacial ice flows as though it were
a viscous substance is well known from studies of
valley glaciers in the Alps and Alaska, and the great
ice sheet of Greenland. A common assumption,
either that the land at one of the great centers of
ice accumulation during the Ice Age must have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">» 241 «</a></span>
many thousands of feet higher, or that the ice must
there have been immensely thick, in order to permit
ice flowage so far out from the center, is not necessary.
Viscous tar slowly poured upon a level surface
will gradually flow out in all directions, and at no
time need the tar at the center of accumulation be
very much thicker than elsewhere. The movement of
glacial ice from the great centers of dispersal during
the Ice Age was much the same in principle,
only in the case of the glaciers the accumulations of
snow and ice were by no means confined to the immediate
centers.</p>

<p>The fronts of the vast ice sheets, like those of
ordinary valley glaciers, must have undergone many
advances and retreats of greater or less consequence.
In the northern Mississippi Valley, and
also in Europe, there is positive proof for five or
six important advances and retreats of the ice which
gave rise to the true interglacial stages. The strongest
evidence is the presence of successive layers of
glacial (morainic) débris piled one upon another,
a given layer often having been oxidized, eroded,
and even covered with plant life before the next or
overlying layer was deposited. Such is the condition
of things throughout much of Iowa, where wells
sunk into the glacial deposits commonly pass
through layers of partly decomposed vegetable matter
at depths of from 100 to 300 feet. Near Toronto,
Canada, the finding of warm climate plants between
two glacial deposits proves that the climate there
during an interglacial stage was much like that of
the southern States to-day. During the great interglacial
stages the vast glaciers were notably restricted
in size, and in some or possibly all, cases they
may have wholly disappeared from the continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">» 242 «</a></span></p>

<p>In former years there was a tendency to ascribe
mighty erosive power to the vast slow-moving ice
sheets, but to-day scarcely any geologist would hold
that the ice really produced large valleys solely by
ice erosion, or that mountains were notably cut
down. Throughout the glaciated region, especially
toward the north, the deep preglacial residual soils
and rotten rocks were nearly all scoured off by the
passage of the ice. That the ice, where properly
shod with rock fragments, actually eroded to at
least little depths into hard and fresh rocks is well
known, but the evidence is clear and conclusive that
the preglacial hills and mountains, and most of the
valleys (including all the large ones), were rarely
more than a little modified in shape and size.</p>

<p>One of the principal effects of the Ice Age is the
widespread distribution of glacial deposits, and
other deposits which were formed under water in
direct association with the ice. Such materials
have been described in the chapter on &ldquo;Glaciers and
Their Work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a direct result of the Ice Age, many thousands
of lakes came into existence throughout the glaciated
region where few, if any, previously existed.
Many of these lasted only while the ice was present
because their waters were held up by walls of ice
acting as dams. Thousands of others still persist,
most of these having their water levels maintained
by dams of glacial débris left by the ice across
valleys. Good examples of lakes of both types, including
a summary of the remarkable history of the
Great Lakes, are considered in the chapter on &ldquo;A
Study of Lakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many drainage changes, gorges, and waterfalls
have also directly resulted from the great Ice Age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">» 243 «</a></span>
In fact it is not too much to say that practically all
true gorges and waterfalls of the glaciated region
have originated as a direct result of the Ice Age.
The most remarkable combination of waterfall and
gorge thus produced is that of the world-famous
Niagara, described in the chapter on &ldquo;Stream
Work.&rdquo; Not only are Niagara Falls and gorge of
postglacial origin but there was no Niagara River
as such before the Ice Age. In New York the well-known
Ausable Chasm, Trenton Falls Gorge, and
Watkins Glen are all excellent examples of gorges
cut since the Ice Age by streams which, because
their old valleys were filled with glacial débris, have
been forced to take new courses. A gorge of very
special interest is that at Little Falls in central New
York. This gorge, two miles long, with its precipitous
walls hundreds of feet high, is the most important
gateway for traffic between the Atlantic
border and the Great Lakes region. The bottom
of this defile contains six tracks of the New York
Central and West Shore Railroads, the Barge Canal,
an important highway, and the Mohawk River. Before
the Ice Age there was a stream divide instead
of a gorge, several hundred feet above the present
river level. During a late stage of the Ice Age, when
the Great Lakes drained through the Mohawk
Valley, a tremendous volume of water passed over
the divide and cut it down to form nearly all of the
gorge except the inner or bottom trench which has
since been eroded by the Mohawk River.</p>

<p>Only a few of the numerous stream changes
directly due to the Ice Age will be briefly referred
to. Certain of the principles involved are exceptionally
well illustrated in the general vicinity of
Saratoga Springs and Lake George, New York.
During the retreat of the great glacier a lobe of ice
occupied the Lake George Valley and forced the
Hudson River west over a divide at Stony Creek.
Then, because of heavy glacial deposits near Corinth,
the Hudson could not continue south through
what had been the preglacial valley of Luzerne
River, but it was forced eastward over a divide in
a low mountain ridge to Glens Falls. The remarkable
shift of the Sacandaga River from its preglacial
channel was caused by the building up of a
great morainic ridge across the valley in the
vicinity of Broadalbin.</p>

<p>The drainage of the basin of the upper Ohio
River has also been revolutionized as a result of the
glaciation. All the drainage of western Pennsylvania
passed northward into Lake Erie just before
the Ice Age instead of southwestward through the
Ohio River as at present.</p>

<p>Rivers as large as the Mississippi and the Missouri
were also more or less locally deflected from
their preglacial courses. Thus the Missouri, which
in preglacial time followed the James River Valley
of eastern South Dakota, was forced, by a great lobe
of retreating ice, to find its present course many
miles farther west.</p>

<p>How long ago did the Ice Age end? In seeking
an answer to this question we should bear in mind
not only the fact that the Ice Age ended at different
times, according to latitude, the more southern districts
having been first freed from ice, but also the
fact that approximately 4,000,000 square miles of
the polar regions are now ice-covered, so that in a
real sense those portions of the earth are still in
an Ice Age. Some of the best estimates of the
length of postglacial time for a given place are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">» 246 «</a></span>
based upon the rate of recession of Niagara Falls,
the average of the estimates being about 25,000
years. The evidence for this conclusion is briefly
set forth in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>. A careful study of the
rate of recession of St. Anthony Falls, Minnesota,
has led to the conclusion that the last retreat of the
ice occurred there from 10,000 to 16,000 years ago.
Certain clays deposited under tidewater since the
last withdrawal of ice in Sweden show a remarkable
succession of alternating layers thought to represent
seasonal changes. By counting the layers it
has been estimated that Stockholm was freed from
ice only 9,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Although the actual duration of the Ice Age is by
no means accurately known, we can be quite sure
that the time represented is far longer than that of
postglacial time. That it must have lasted fully
500,000 years seems certain when due consideration
is given to amount of time necessary to bring about
the repeated changes of climate between the glacial
and interglacial stages; the amount of plant accumulation
during the interglacial stages; the amount of
weathering and erosion of the various layers of
glacial deposits. Some estimates run as high as
1,500,000 years for the duration of the Ice Age, and
an average is about 1,000,000 years, which probably
indicates, at least roughly, the order of magnitude
of the time involved.</p>

<p>When it is considered not only that the fact of
the great Ice Age was not even thought of until
1837, but also that many factors enter into the general
problem of the climate of geologic time, it is
not surprising that the cause (or causes) of the
glacial climate is still not definitely known. A few
of the various hypotheses which have been advocated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">» 247 «</a></span>
to account for the glacial climate will now be
very briefly referred to. One is that the increased
cold (not more than 10 to 15 degrees for the yearly
average) was brought about by the notably increased
altitudes of late Tertiary and early Quaternary
times in northern North America and Europe.
In this connection it is interesting to note that the
four times of real glaciation during geologic time
(mid-Proterozoic, early Paleozoic, late Paleozoic,
and early Cenozoic) did occur directly after great
crustal disturbances and notable uplifts of land.
According to this hypothesis the interglacial stages
would have to be explained by a rather unreasonable
assumption of repeated rising and sinking of
the glaciated lands.</p>

<p>Another hypothesis, long held in favor, is based
upon certain astronomical considerations. Thus
we now have winter in the northern hemisphere
when the earth is nearest the sun, but in about
10,500 years, due to wobbling of the earth on
its axis, our winter will occur when the earth is
farthest from the sun, thus making the winters
longer and colder, and the summers shorter and
hotter. After a much longer period of time the
earth will be millions of miles farther from the sun
in winter than in summer and this would still further
accentuate the length and coldness of the
winters. The interglacial stages represent the
10,500 year periods when the earth in winter
(northern hemisphere) is nearest the sun. A difficulty
in the way of accepting this hypothesis is that
it is inconceivable that each glacial and interglacial
stage lasted only 10,500 years. Another objection
to the hypothesis as an explanation of Ice Ages is
that it is directly opposed by the fact of widespread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">» 248 «</a></span>
glaciation at low latitudes either side of the equator
during the late Paleozoic Ice Age.</p>

<p>Another hypothesis is based upon variations in
quantity of carbonic acid gas and water vapor in
the air. Increase or decrease of these constituents
causes increase or decrease of temperature because
they have high capacities for absorbing heat. &ldquo;The
great elevation of the land at the close of the Tertiary
seems to afford conditions favorable both for
the consumption of carbon dioxide in large quantities
(by weathering of rocks) and for the reduction
of the water content of the air. Depletion of these
heat-absorbing elements was equivalent to the thinning
of the thermal blanket which they constitute.
If it was thinned, the temperature was reduced....
By variations in the consumption of carbon dioxide,
especially in its absorption and escape from the
ocean, the hypothesis attempts to explain the periodicity
of glaciation (i.e., glacial and interglacial
stages).&rdquo; (Chamberlin and Salisbury.)</p>

<p>Still another suggested explanation is based upon
variability of amount of heat radiated by the sun.
Slight variations are now known to take place, and
possibly in the past during certain periods of time
these variations may have been sufficiently great to
cause a glacial climate with interglacial stages.</p>

<p>Here, as in the case of so many other great
natural phenomena, a single, simple explanation
does not seem sufficient to account for all the features
of the several well-known glacial epochs of
geologic time. Two or more hypotheses, or parts of
hypotheses, must more than likely be combined to
explain a particular Ice Age.</p>

<p class="caption3">EVOLUTION OF PLANTS</p>

<div class="dropcap">H</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">H</span>AVE we any knowledge regarding the beginning
of life on our planet? Our answer to this
question must be decidedly in the negative. We
can, however, be very positive in regard to two
important matters concerning life in early geological
time, namely, that plants must have existed
before animals, and that the very oldest known
(Archeozoic) rocks of the earth contain vestiges of
organisms. We may be sure that plants preceded
animals because animal life ultimately depends upon
plants for its food supply or, in other words, all
animals could never have been carnivorous. Now,
if we can prove that organisms existed during
Archeozoic time, it is evident that plants at least
must have lived in that oldest known era of earth
history. That living things did then exist is proved
by the common occurrence of graphite, a crystallized
form of carbon, in the oldest known of the
Archeozoic rocks. The facts that flakes of graphite
are abundantly scattered through many layers of
strata of Archeozoic Age, and that adjacent layers
of strata contain such varying amounts of graphite,
render it practically certain that such graphite represents
the carbon of organisms. Graphite existing
under such conditions could not be of igneous origin.
Carbonaceous or bituminous strata, so called because
they contain more or less decomposed organic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">» 250 «</a></span>
matter, would, when crystallized under conditions
of metamorphism, yield graphite-bearing rocks exactly
like those of Archeozoic Age, and there is
every reason to believe that this was their origin.
But, since only graphite (carbon) of the Archeozoic
organisms remains, the rest having disappeared
through chemical change or decomposition, it is impossible
to say whether much or all of it represents
original plants or animals. In any case we can be
very sure about the existence of plants (probably
very simple or primitive types) in Archeozoic time,
but the presence of any form of animal life has not
been proved.</p>

<p>In the next, or Proterozoic era, some plants and
animals of definite types are known to have existed
and, from here on in the present chapter, it is our
purpose to consider the salient points in the geological
history of plants, taking up the main types in
the regular order of their appearance from the remote
Proterozoic days to the present. The very
oldest known definitely determinable fossils of any
kind are the more or less rounded masses of crudely
concentric layers of carbonate of lime from one to
fifteen inches in diameter found in middle Proterozoic
limestone of western Ontario, Canada. Similar
forms are abundant in late Proterozoic strata of
Montana. They occur in large numbers as layers or
reefs, in many cases repeating themselves through
hundreds or even thousands of feet of strata. Careful
studies have shown that these forms are the
limey secretions of some of the very simplest types
of plants, that is thallophytes (e.g., seaweeds),
which lived in water.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to describe the plants of Paleozoic
and later time, the reader should be impressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">» 251 «</a></span>
with the important fact that plants of higher and
higher types came into existence throughout geological
time in almost exactly the botanical order of
their classification, that is to say, from the very simplest
types (thallophytes) of Proterozoic time there
were gradually evolved, through the long geological
ages, higher and higher plant forms reaching a
climax in the complex and highly organized plants
of the present time. This is the most significant
general fact in regard to the geological history of
plants. For the convenience of the reader the
largest subdivisions in the classification of plants
are here given.</p>

</table>

<p>Throughout the first two periods&mdash;Cambrian and
Ordovician&mdash;of the Paleozoic era, plant life appears
to have made little or no progress toward higher
forms. The very simple Thallophytes (e.g., seaweeds)
continued to secrete concentric layers of
carbonate of lime in almost exactly the same way
as during the middle and late Proterozoic era. Remarkable
reefs of such forms occur in the late Cambrian
limestone near Saratoga Springs, New York,
where one locality has been set aside as a state park.
During the Ordovician there were seaweeds of the
more familiar branching types without carbonate of
lime supports, and these have left very perfect impressions
in some of the Ordovician strata.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">» 252 «</a></span></p>

<p>During the Silurian period seaweeds continued,
as, in fact, they did throughout succeeding geologic
time to the present. The Silurian strata seem to
contain some vestiges of the first-known land plants,
though the records are meager and some of the
specimens are of a doubtful character. Most interesting
of all is a fern or fernlike plant found
in France. When we consider the profusion of
land plants (all of relatively simple types) of
the next or Devonian period, it seems certain
that their progenitors must have existed in the
Silurian, and their remains may very likely be
discovered.</p>

<p><a name="Pteridophytes" id="Pteridophytes"></a>Beginning with the Devonian period of the Paleozoic
era the records show that important advances
had taken place in the evolution of the plant
kingdom. Among the very simple Thallophyte
plants some seaweeds of unusually large size occur
in fossil form, but the important fact is that all
the principal subdivisions of the typical higher non-flowering
plants (Pteridophytes) as well as Pteridosperms,
and even some primitive representatives
of the lower order flowering plants (gymnosperms)
were well represented in the Devonian. Our knowledge
of land plants earlier than the Devonian
amounts to almost nothing and they certainly could
not have been at all prominent, but the fossil
records make it very clear that many Devonian land
areas were clad with rich and diversified plant life.
There were even forests, probably the first on earth,
but they were far different, both in general and in
particular, from those of to-day because the trees
were all of exceptionally low organization types.
During the next two periods&mdash;Mississippian and
Pennsylvanian&mdash;there was no really important progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">» 253 «</a></span>
in the evolution of plants, and since these
remarkable types of land plants have left such
wonderfully preserved records in strata of the Pennsylvanian
or great Coal Age, we shall proceed to descriptions
of the main types of that time, especially
those which contributed to the formation of beds
of coal.</p>

<p>As shown by the abundant records, the land plant
life of Pennsylvanian time must have been not
only prolific but exceedingly varied. Thousands of
species have been unearthed from the coal-bearing
formations alone, and these must represent only a
fraction of all species of plants which lived during
the period. Most prominent of all were the giant
Lycopods constituting the lowest main subdivision
of the Pteridophytes (see <a href="#Pteridophytes">above classification</a>).
These great, non-flowering plants were at once the
biggest, most common and conspicuous trees of the
extensive swamp forests, and they were the greatest
contributors to the formation of coal (<a href="#Plate_15a">Plate 15</a>).
Many species have been described. They commonly
attained heights of 50 to 100 feet and diameters of
2 to 6 feet. In one important type the fairly numerous
branches bristled with stiff, needle-shaped
leaves. When the leaves dropped off the older or
trunk portions, scars were left spirally arranged
around the trunks of the trees. In another important
type the leaf scars were vertically arranged on
the lower portions of the tree trunks. The upper
portions of the trunks (rarely branched) were
thickly set with long, slender leaves, which in some
species were two or three feet long. An interesting
fact is that the inner parts of the trunks of the great
Lycopods were filled with soft, pithy material. This
explains why the fossil trees are nearly always flattened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">» 254 «</a></span>
out, as a result of burial within the earth. The
nonbranching type of Lycopod has been totally extinct
for millions of years, while the branching type
is to-day represented only by small, mostly delicate,
trailing plants familiarly known as &ldquo;club mosses&rdquo;
and &ldquo;ground pines.&rdquo; The most conspicuous trees of
the great Pennsylvanian lowlands and swamps
have, indeed, left meager modern representatives,
and here we have an excellent illustration of a once
prominent group of plants which has dwindled away
almost to extinction.</p>

<p>Another common type of Pennsylvanian vegetation
was the so-called &ldquo;horsetail&rdquo; plant or giant
rush. The much smaller scouring rush, represented
by several species to-day, is the direct descendant
of this type which, during later Paleozoic time, grew
to be 50 to 90 feet high and 1 to 2 feet in diameter.
The long, slender trunks filled with pith were segmented
with variously shaped leaves arranged in
whorls around the joints. A fine, vertical-fluted
structure without leaf scars characterized the surfaces
of the trunk.</p>

<p>Recent study has shown that many of the Pennsylvanian
plants, long classed as true ferns, were
really &ldquo;seed ferns,&rdquo; as described below. Many of
the true ferns grew to be real trees up to fifty or
sixty feet high, but all Paleozoic types were primitive
in structure as compared with modern ferns.</p>

<p>Very remarkable among the later Paleozoic plants
were the Pteridosperms, represented by the so-called
&ldquo;seed ferns.&rdquo; These now wholly extinct plants seem
to have formed the connecting link between the seedless,
flowerless plants (Cryptogams) and the seed-bearing,
flowering plants (Phanerogams), because
they bore seeds but not flowers. Many of them were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">» 255 «</a></span>
small and herbaceous, but others were tall trees, in
general appearance resembling the tree ferns. &ldquo;Seed
ferns,&rdquo; which play such an important part in the
evolution of plants, are not known to have existed
after Paleozoic time.</p>

<p>During the latter half of the Paleozoic era some
very primitive types of flowering plants (Gymnosperms)
existed. Most abundant of these were the
so-called Cordaites, which were the tallest trees of
the time, some having reached heights of over 100
feet. The upper portions only bore numerous
branches supplied with many simple, parallel-veined,
strap-shaped leaves up to six feet long and six
inches wide. Excepting the pithy cores the trunks
of these trees were of real wood covered with thick
bark. Trees of this kind became extinct in the
early Mesozoic era.</p>

<p>Very late in the Paleozoic (Permian period) two
other types of the simple flowering plants (Gymnosperms)
made their appearance. These were the
cycads and conifers, which were the most conspicuous
trees during the first two periods of the Mesozoic
era. The cycads reached their culmination in
the Jurassic period, but they still exist in modified
form in some parts of the world. The short, stout
trunk was crowned with long, stiff, palm-like leaves.
In fact, the cycads are distantly related to the
palms, which belong to a higher group of plants.
Some specimens of cycads, especially from the Mesozoic
strata of South Dakota, are so wonderfully
fossilized that even the detailed structures of trunks,
leaves, flowers, and seeds are so perfectly preserved
that almost as much is known about these plants of
millions of years ago as though they were living
forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">» 256 «</a></span></p>

<p>The conifers, with which are classed present-day
pines, spruces, and many other evergreen trees,
gradually took on a more modern aspect, so that late
in the Mesozoic era they were much like those now
living. Among the most interesting trees were the
sequoias, to which the living &ldquo;big trees&rdquo; and red-woods
of California belong. These began in relatively
late Mesozoic time, reached their climax in
numbers, variety of species, and widespread distribution
in the early Cenozoic era; and are now
almost extinct, being represented by only two
species in local portions of California. Cordaites,
trees which were so large and abundant in later
Paleozoic time, were reduced to extinction in the
early Mesozoic era.</p>

<p>During Mesozoic time the Thallophytes, represented
by seaweeds, were common. Among the
Pteridophytes the ferns and &ldquo;horsetail&rdquo; plants were
fairly common, but the very large forms gradually
gave way to much smaller ones during Mesozoic time.
The giant Lycopods of later Paleozoic time dwindled
almost to extinction even in early Mesozoic time, so
that from that time to the present they have been
very small and relatively insignificant.</p>

<p>Tens of millions of years of earth history had
passed before the true flowering plants&mdash;the Angiosperms&mdash;appeared
upon the earth. The Cretaceous
period marks their advent. So far as known,
these plants originated along the eastern side of
North America, and very soon after their establishment
they spread over the earth with amazing
rapidity and dominated the vegetation as they do to-day,
more than half of the existing species of plants
being Angiosperms. Among the common types
which have been unearthed from Cretaceous strata
are palms, grasses, maples, oaks, elms, figs, magnolias,
willows, beeches, chestnuts, and poplars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">» 257 «</a></span></p>

<p>The introduction of the higher flowering plants
(Angiosperms) "was, perhaps, the most important
and far-reaching event in the whole history of vegetation,
not only because they almost immediately became
dominant, but also because of their influence
upon the animal life of the succeeding periods.
Hardly had flowers appeared, before a great horde
of insects, which fed upon their honey or pollen,
seem to have sprung into existence. The nutritious
grasses and the various nuts, seeds, and fruits afforded
a better food for noncarnivores than ever
before in the history of the world. It was to be expected,
therefore, that some new type of animal life
would be developed to take advantage of this superior
food supply. As we shall see in the discussion
of the Tertiary (next <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">chapter</a>), the mammals,
which kept a subordinate position throughout the
Mesozoic, rapidly took on bulk and variety and acquired
possession of the earth as soon as they
became adapted to this new food, quickly supplanting
the great reptiles of the Mesozoic." (Cleland.)</p>

<p>During the present or Cenozoic era vegetation
gradually took on a more and more modern aspect
until the existing species were developed. The
grasses especially developed and spread rapidly, but
the cereals did not evolve until late in the era.
Certain single-celled plants, called diatoms, may be
especially mentioned, for they must have literally
swarmed in some of the Tertiary seas which spread
over parts of the present lands. "The microscopic
plants which form siliceous shells, called diatoms,
make extensive deposits in some places. One
stratum near Richmond, Virginia, is thirty feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">» 258 «</a></span>
thick and is many miles in extent; another, near
Monterey, California, is fifty feet thick, and the
material is as white and fine as chalk, which it resembles
in appearance; another, near Bilin, in
Bohemia, is fourteen feet thick.... Ehrenberg
has calculated that a cubic inch of the fine, earthy
rock contains about forty-one thousand millions of
organisms. Such accumulations of diatoms are
made both in fresh waters and salt, and in those of
the ocean at all depths." (J. D. Dana.)</p>

to reasonably well understand where the important

in, and how those types bear upon the doctrine of
evolution. The accompanying, very brief, general

<p>Before entering into a brief but rather systematic
discussion of some of the most important
types of animals which lived during geological
time, it may be well for the reader to have in mind
some of the most important conclusions which have
been reached as a result of the study of the fossil
animal records. These conclusions may be summarized
as follows:</p>

<p>1. Animal life existed many millions of years ago.</p>

<p>2. Not only the animals of to-day, but also those
of any given geological period, directly descended
from those of preceding geological periods.</p>

<p>3. Animal life has undergone continuous change
since its introduction upon the earth, so that each
group of strata, representing a particular geological
age, contains a characteristic assemblage of fossil
animals.</p>

<p>4. Many of the changes in the history of animals
have been progressive or evolutionary, so that
strata of early geological time contain distinctly
more primitive or lower order forms than the strata
of late geological time. But, while the line of evolution
has been maintained without a break, culminating
in man, there have been many offshoots of a
retrogressive nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">» 261 «</a></span></p>

<p>5. Even as far along in geological time as the
early Paleozoic era, the highest subkingdom&mdash;vertebrates&mdash;had
no representative whatever. In other
words, all the important subdivisions of animal life
from a little below fishes to man have been evolved
since about the close of the Ordovician period.</p>

<p>6. Any species of animal which ever became extinct
has never been known to reappear, and literally
tens of thousands of species are known to have
become extinct.</p>

<p>7. No species like those now living are found in
the more ancient strata, such being confined to the
strata of relatively recent geological dates.</p>

<p>8. While more and more highly organized animals
have continuously been evolved, many of the earlier
and simpler types have persisted, a remarkable case
in point being the single-celled animals called foraminifers
which may be traced, without very notable
change, through the tens of millions of years of geological
time from the late Proterozoic era to the
present day.</p>

<p>9. Many species have been able to maintain themselves
practically without change through long
stretches of geological time, while others have had
only very brief existence.</p>

<p>When did animal life begin on the earth, and
what were the first forms like? We can only partially
answer the first question by saying that animals
have existed for tens of millions of years,
certainly as early at least as Proterozoic time. Up
to the present time we are utterly in the dark as
to what the earliest animal forms looked like, but
we have positive knowledge that the oldest forms
found as fossils in the rocks represent creatures
which were far more primitive and lower in organization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">» 262 «</a></span>
than many animals of to-day, and that since
those oldest known forms lived, the animal kingdom
has undergone various profound alterations. In
view of the above statements, and also the fact that
the oldest known plant forms were extremely simple
or single-celled, it is more than likely that the
first animal life of the earth was single-celled. In
harmony with this view is the fact that fossil
single-celled animals are found in the very oldest
(Proterozoic) rocks which contain any definitely
determinable fossil animals.</p>

<p>Do the most ancient known rocks show that animal
life existed during Archeozoic time? In the
preceding chapter we pointed out the fact that the
carbon (in the form of graphite), so commonly
present in those most ancient known strata, proves
the existence of life of some kind during Archeozoic
time. But because nothing like definitely determinable
fossil forms have thus far been discovered in
those rocks, we cannot be sure whether the carbon
represents plant or animal life or both, though certainly
plants of very low order at least must have
existed. Because of the intense alteration (metamorphism)
of those very old strata, all definite
forms have long since been obliterated as such. We
may, however, in the light of the vast evolution
which took place through succeeding geological
time, be very sure that any animals which may have
existed during Archeozoic time were in general
much simpler forms than those of even early Paleozoic
time.</p>

<p>The early and middle Proterozoic strata throw
no more light upon the early history of animal life
than do the Archeozoic strata. The upper or later
Proterozoic rocks, however, contain the oldest recognizable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">» 263 «</a></span>
animal fossils. Very recently fossil remains
of single-celled, shell-bearing Protozoans have been
found in northern France, while the upper Proterozoic
strata of the Rocky Mountains in Montana,
and the Grand Canyon of Arizona have yielded
worm tracks, a Molluscoid (brachiopod) and fragments
of lower forms of Arthropods. This record,
although very meager, clearly proves that animal
life was so well advanced by late Proterozoic time,
that next to the highest subkingdom was actually
represented (see <a href="#classification">above classification</a>), and that
there must have been a long line of simpler and
simpler ancestors, probably extending far back into
the Archeozoic era. When we stop to consider that
Archeozoic and Proterozoic time was fully as long
as all succeeding geological time, it is not so surprising
that fairly highly developed animals (except
Vertebrates) had been evolved before the close
of the Proterozoic era.</p>

<p>In regard to abundance of fossil animals the oldest
(Cambrian) Paleozoic strata stand out in marked
contrast to the Proterozoic. Many hundreds of
species of animal fossils have been described from
Cambrian strata, and a great many others yet
remain to be discovered. Cambrian fossils are remarkably
numerous, varied in species, and complex
in organization (<a href="#Plate_13">Plate 13</a>). All subkingdoms of
animals except the Vertebrates were represented,
though usually only by the simpler types in each
subkingdom. It is quite generally agreed that no
less than 50 per cent of animal evolution had
taken place before the beginning of the Cambrian
period. The reader should, however, clearly bear
in mind that tremendous advances in evolution have
taken place since early Cambrian time when not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">» 264 «</a></span>
only all forms from lower scale Arthropods to the
highest mammals (including man) have evolved,
but also when many thousands of species of lower
subkingdom animals developed.</p>

<p>Why are the very early Paleozoic strata so rich
in fossils, while the immediately preceding Proterozoic
rocks show so few? The seemingly sudden
appearance of so many highly developed animals
in earliest Paleozoic (Cambrian) time is one of the
most important considerations in the history of
animal life, and it is by no means definitely understood.
The following statements bear directly upon
the problem: The early animal forms were probably
soft or gelatinous without shells and lived mostly
in the open sea where food (seaweeds, etc.) was
abundant. Such animals were very unfavorable
for preservation in fossil form. Then, late in Proterozoic
time or very early in the Paleozoic, a severe
struggle for existence set in, probably due to crowding
along shores, and hard parts began to develop
both for support and defensive purposes. Such hard
parts or shells were commonly favorable for fossilization.
This view is strongly supported by the
fact that very thin shells only are known from late
Proterozoic rocks, and mostly very thin shells from
the earliest Cambrian, the heavier shells having
been evolved later. A fact of importance to bear
in mind in this connection is that just at the critical
time (late Proterozoic) in shell development,
the lands of the earth were undergoing widespread
and deep erosion as pointed out early in the chapter
on &ldquo;Ancient Earth History.&rdquo; The earliest Cambrian
strata, therefore, nearly everywhere rest upon
the deeply eroded surface of the Proterozoic rocks
so that the transition strata&mdash;the very ones which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">» 265 «</a></span>
would contain most fossils of the early shell development
stage&mdash;are nearly everywhere missing.
Finally, mention should be made of the fact, that
all Archeozoic strata are profoundly altered (metamorphosed),
and so are nearly all Proterozoic strata,
except the later. Fossils once present in those rocks
would of course have been obliterated by the process
of metamorphism, but the fact remains that very
considerable thicknesses of practically unaltered
Proterozoic strata show few if any animal fossils.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to a rather systematic consideration
of the most interesting and significant
types of creatures which have inhabited the earth
since the beginning of Paleozoic time at least twenty-five
million years ago. It is our purpose to bring
out the salient features in the history of each subkingdom
of animals, beginning with the lowest
or simplest, and taking up in turn the higher and
higher subkingdoms. By this method the reader
may easily follow the main thread of organic evolution
or progressive change which runs through most
of the known history of animal life of our planet,
and which is so important in the science of geology.</p>

<p>Protozoans, which include all the tiny single-celled
animals, are known in fossil form even in late
Proterozoic rocks and, as proved by the fossil
records, they have been more or less abundant ever
since, even now swarming in large portions of the
surface sea waters. One of the most remarkable
facts in the history of animal life is, that such exceedingly
simple creatures persisted almost without
change through the tens of millions of years when
such profound and even revolutionary changes took
place in the animal kingdom in general. The only
fossil Protozoans are those which developed delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">» 266 «</a></span>
shells either of carbonate of lime (the foraminifers)
or silica. Special mention should be made of the
Cretaceous period when foraminifers must have
been exceedingly profuse in clear sea waters which
spread over the Gulf Coastal Plain of the United
States, parts of southern England, much of France,
and other areas, as proved by their accumulated
shells which make up formations of chalk hundreds
of feet in thickness and many miles in extent.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 293px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.</span>&mdash;A compound colony of fossil graptolites characteristic of
late Ordovician time, fully 20,000,000 years ago. Each little prong
once held a tiny individual living graptolite which was a very simple
type of animal belonging to the subkingdom called &ldquo;C&oelig;lenterates.&rdquo;
(Modified after Ruedemann.)</div>
</div>

<p>The C&oelig;lenterates, which comprise the simplest
of the many-celled animals, are saclike forms with
mouth openings, but with few other differentiations
of parts. All are marine animals. Of these the
sponges are porous, and the other types (including
corals) have tentacles around their mouths. Sponges
have been more or less common from early Paleozoic
time to the present, and they have undergone relatively
little change. &ldquo;Jellyfishes,&rdquo; which are in
truth not fishes at all, are wholly soft or gelatinous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">» 267 «</a></span>
C&oelig;lenterates which have left some very remarkable
impressions and casts in strata of very early
Paleozoic age, those very ancient forms evidently
having been almost exactly like those of to-day.
Graptolites were slender, plumelike, delicate forms
consisting of colonies of tiny individuals, in many
cases in branching or radiating combinations. They
existed only during the first half of the Paleozoic
era. Both because they floated in the open sea, thus
permitting widespread distribution, and because
they underwent many distinct species changes during
short geologic intervals, they are among the most
useful fossils for separating the various subdivisions
of strata of the earlier Paleozoic.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 468px;">
<a name="Fig_50" id="Fig_50"></a><img src="images/fig50.png" width="468" height="163" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span>&mdash;Corals, representing the very simple subkingdom of animals
called &ldquo;C&oelig;lenterates&rdquo;: a, fossil shell of an individual &ldquo;cup coral&rdquo; found
only in Paleozoic strata; b, a compound or &ldquo;chain coral&rdquo; skeleton found
only in relatively old Paleozoic strata; and c, part of a modern coral
colony showing living corals.</div>
</div>

<p>Corals comprise another important branch of the
C&oelig;lenterates. During the Cambrian period there
were corallike sponges and possibly simple corals,
but from the early Ordovician to the present true
corals have been common, especially in the clearer,
warmer seas. Their carbonate of lime skeletons
have accumulated to help build up great limestone
formations representing almost every geologic age
from early Paleozoic time to the present. Paleozoic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">» 268 «</a></span>
corals were in general notably different from those
of later time. There were three main types including
the compound &ldquo;honeycomb&rdquo; and &ldquo;chain&rdquo; types,
and the solitary or compound &ldquo;cup&rdquo; type. They all
had four, or multiples of four, radiating partitions;
were rarely branched; and were generally large,
some individual cup corals ranging in length from
half an inch to a foot or more. Modern corals (beginning
with the Mesozoic) have six or eight partitions;
are nearly all profusely branched; and are
mostly tiny individuals.</p>

<p>Echinoderms are all marine animals, including
the so-called &ldquo;starfishes,&rdquo; which are not really fishes.
They have body cavity, with digestive canal, low
order nervous system, and a water circulatory system.
Most of them have radially segmented shells
or skeletons. The oldest fossil forms are found in
Cambrian strata, these being very simple or primitive
types, with a bladderlike head set on the end
of a segmented stem, both head and stem having
been supported by carbonate of lime. Such forms
lived only to middle Paleozoic time. Ordovician
strata contain representatives of all the main types
of Echinoderms in well-fossilized forms.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 436px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span>&mdash;Fossil Echinoderms or so-called &ldquo;starfishes&rdquo;: a, simple type
known as the &ldquo;stone lily&rdquo; with head, stem, and roots intact from Silurian
strata; b and c, irregular and regular higher type Echinoderms called
&ldquo;sea urchins&rdquo; from Cretaceous strata.</div>
</div>

<p>A stemmed Echinoderm of special interest, first
known from the Ordovician, has persisted to the
present day. It is the so-called &ldquo;sea lily&rdquo; or &ldquo;stone
lily,&rdquo; consisting of a complex, headlike portion attached
to the sea bottom by a long segmented stem,
the whole being supported by lime carbonate. They
were very numerous during the Silurian, but they
seem to have culminated in variety of species and
numbers of individuals during the Mississippian
period when they were exceedingly profuse. Hundreds
of species of &ldquo;stone lilies&rdquo; are known from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">» 269 «</a></span>
Mississippian strata alone, and in certain localities,
as at Crawfordsville, Ind., and Burlington, Ia., the
&ldquo;stone lily&rdquo; remains are so numerous that when living
they must have literally forested parts of the sea
bottom. From Mississippian time to middle Mesozoic
time they occupied a relatively subordinate position
when they again developed in great profusion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">» 270 «</a></span>
The Mesozoic forms were distinctly more like those
of to-day, and it scarcely seems credible that any
creature could have contained such a multiplicity of
hard parts, more than 600,000 segments having been
counted in a single fossil from Jurassic strata. The
&ldquo;sea lilies&rdquo; of to-day are relatively unimportant.</p>

<p>The familiar five-pointed &ldquo;starfishes,&rdquo; so common
along our seacoasts, are first known from the
Ordovician, and they persisted through the many
millions of years to the present time with remarkably
little change. The so-called &ldquo;sea urchins&rdquo; live
in rounded, segmented lime-carbonate shells bristling
with movable spines. &ldquo;Sea urchins&rdquo; are first
known from the Ordovician, but they did not become
abundant and diversified until Mesozoic time, when
many of them took on a very modern aspect.</p>

<p>Worms are known to have existed ever since late
Proterozoic time, as proved by the occurrence of
tracks, borings and more rarely delicate impressions
on rock surfaces. Because of their softness
they have rarely been well fossilized and are,
therefore, of no great evolutionary or geological
importance.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 466px;">
<a name="Fig_52" id="Fig_52"></a><img src="images/fig52.png" width="466" height="98" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span>&mdash;Fossil brachiopods belonging to the subkingdom of animals
known as &ldquo;Molluscoids&rdquo;: a, b, c, forms characteristic of the Ordovician,
Devonian, and Triassic periods, respectively.</div>
</div>

<p>The subkingdom Molluscoids has been richly represented
by both the so-called &ldquo;sea mosses&rdquo; and
brachiopods. The &ldquo;sea mosses&rdquo; form colonies of
tiny mosslike tufts, resembling corals outwardly,
though they are much more highly organized. They
have been common from Ordovician time to the
present, their carbonate of lime skeletons often having
contributed to the building of limestone formations.
Brachiopods always have two external shells
or valves, in most cases working on a hinge, and
also a pair of long, spiral-fringed arms associated
with the soft part of the animal inside the shells.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">» 271 «</a></span>
They differ from the other type of bivalve (e.g.,
clam, oyster) in that they are symmetrical with
reference to a plane passed through the middle of
the shells at right angles to the hinge line. They
have rarely grown to be more than a few inches
long. A few scant brachiopod remains are known
from the late Proterozoic, but throughout known
geologic time they reached their greatest development
in the Paleozoic era, more especially in the
Devonian period. Combining number of species and
number of individuals, the brachiopods probably
hold the record of all important groups of fossil
animals, more than 7,000 species being known.
Many layers of rock are filled with their shells
(<a href="#Plate_14a">Plate 14</a>). Since the close of the Paleozoic they
have fallen off notably, and are now represented by
relatively few small forms. From the standpoint of
evolution it is interesting to note that in very early
Paleozoic time the brachiopods were mostly small,
of relatively simple organization, and their thin
shells were not joined by hinges. Later they became
larger and more complex and their thicker
shells worked on hinges. Nearly all the Paleozoic
forms had long, straight hinge lines, which made it
difficult for their enemies to open them. Along
with the change to narrower, curved hinge lines
came the decline of the tribe. They have been of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">» 272 «</a></span>
great value to the geologist in subdividing the geological
column of strata into its many formations.</p>

<p>The Mollusks, which are more highly organized
than the Molluscoids, have more or less distinctly
developed heads and locomotive organs. Many
thousands of species are now extinct, the classes of
most geological importance being represented by
clams, snails, and the pearly nautilus. Most of them
have shells and gills for breathing. The members
of the simplest group, well represented by the clam
tribe, possess two similar shells working on hinges,
so that in this regard they are much like brachiopods,
but, unlike the latter, they are not symmetrical with
reference to a plane at right angles to the hinge
line. Cambrian strata contain the oldest known of
the fossil forms where they are small, relatively
thin-shelled, and rare. In marked contrast to the
brachiopods these bivalves have rather steadily increased
in numbers of species and individuals to the
present time, now being represented by thousands
of forms. During the Mesozoic era they greatly out-numbered
the brachiopod bivalves and took on a
more distinctly modern aspect, when the oyster
tribe and closely related types were prominently developed.
Culmination in size and thickness of shell
seem to have been reached in early Cenozoic time,
strata of that age in certain places, for example in
Georgia and southern California, being filled with
oyster shells 10 to 20 inches long and 4 to 6 inches
thick! In addition to their gigantic size and thickness,
many of the shells were fluted or ribbed, and
so they represented an extreme type of defensive
armor among the lower animals.</p>

<p>Snails have existed from the earliest Paleozoic era
to the present time, and the outstanding fact of interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">» 273 «</a></span>
concerning them is that they furnish one of
the finest illustrations of an important class of
animals which has undergone practically no conspicuous
change or evolution during all those millions
of years of time.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 487px;">
<a name="Fig_53" id="Fig_53"></a><img src="images/fig53.png" width="487" height="622" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span>&mdash;Sketches of chambered cephalopods showing the main steps
in the evolution of the shell forms and compartment partitions: a, b,
the only kinds in Cambrian time; c, d, forms added in the Ordovician;
e, added in the Devonian; f, added in the late Paleozoic; g, h, characteristic
of the Mesozoic era; and i, a living form (pearly nautilus) cut
through. (Drawn by the author.)</div>
</div>

<p>We shall now turn our attention to the highest
order of Mollusks&mdash;the cephalopods. These creatures,
whose heads are armed with powerful
tentacles and supplied with complex eyes, propel
themselves by forcible ejection of water. One general
type&mdash;the chambered cephalopod&mdash;has a shell
divided into compartments (e.g., modern pearly
nautilus) which are successively built up and abandoned
by the animal as it grows larger. These
chamber-shelled cephalopods constitute one of the
most remarkable and instructive illustrations of
evolutionary change within any important subgroup
of invertebrate animals, ranging from early
Paleozoic to the present. Both because of the abundance
of fossil forms in rocks of all these periods of
geological times, and because certain of the evolutionary
changes are so clearly expressed in the well preserved
shell portions, they are specially adapted
for study. In the late Cambrian only straight
and slightly curved forms with smooth, nearly
straight chamber partitions existed. Notable advance
took place during the next (Ordovician)
period when there were straight, curved, open-coiled,
and even close-coiled forms. All had simple partitions,
and the straighter forms predominated. "The
size attained by the Ordovician cephalopods was
probably never surpassed by representatives of the
class. Some of the (straight) shells were twelve to
fifteen feet in length, and a foot in diameter. From
this great size they ranged down to or below the size
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">» 274 «</a></span>
of a pipe stem." (Chamberlin and Salisbury.) They
were more than likely the undisputed masters of the
Ordovician seas. Silurian time marked no important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">» 275 «</a></span>
change in their structures, but the coiled forms
predominated for the first time. During the second
half of the Paleozoic era all preceding types with
simple partitions persisted, but in some forms the
simple partitions gradually became angled and
finally rather complexly curved. During the Mesozoic
era the partition lines of the close-coiled forms
evolved until a most remarkable degree of complexity
was attained, comparable, indeed, to the sutures
of the human skull plates. These remarkable forms
called ammonites, of which more than 2,000 species
are known, began with the Mesozoic, reached their
climax, and passed out of existence toward the close
of the same era. Certain strata of Jurassic age are
literally filled with ammonites, some shells being
several feet in diameter. Various eccentric changes
took place in the ammonites shortly before their
extinction. Some shells became uncoiled and even
straight, thus outwardly at least showing reversion
to the original early Paleozoic ancestors, but with
retention of the complex partitions. Others assumed
spiral shapes and still others became curved or
coiled at each end. While these extraordinary evolutionary
changes were going on among the chambers
of cephalopods during Mesozoic time, some of
the ancient close-coiled forms with very simple partitions
managed to persist. In fact this simple type,
almost exactly like its early Paleozoic ancestor, has
been the only one out of this whole remarkable class
of animals to persist to the present time, being now
barely represented by the well-known pearly nautilus
of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>During the Mesozoic era the highest type of
cephalopod, represented by modern squids and so-called
&ldquo;cuttlefishes,&rdquo; branched off and developed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">» 276 «</a></span>
great profusion. These had slender internal shells,
but no external chambered shells. An inky black
liquid secreted in a bag was forced out to cloud the
water when the animal was escaping its enemy, thus
antedating by millions of years the principle of
smoke screen so effectively used by ships during
the World War. Some Jurassic species got to be
over two feet long, and a few specimens of that age
have been found in such perfect state of preservation
that drawings of the fossils have actually been
made with the ink (after moistening) taken from
their own ink bags.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter we shall take up
the salient points in the geological history of Arthropods
which constitute the highest subkingdom of
all animals except the Vertebrates. They are now
very abundant and varied, familiar examples being
crabs and insects. A few scant remains of simpler
forms are known from the Proterozoic, but since
very early Paleozoic time they have been very
common and have undergone great evolutionary
changes. A few striking examples only will be
dwelt upon. Among the most common and interesting
of all Paleozoic animals were the trilobites,
distantly related to modern lobsters and crabs.</p>

</div>

<p>Some of these grew to be two feet long, but usually
they were only one or two inches long. First known
from the earliest Paleozoic, they reached their culmination
relatively early in the era and then
dwindled away to utter extinction before its close.
"They were characteristic of the Paleozoic era, beginning
in great variety in the Lower Cambrian
and dominating the seas of the Cambrian (300
species) and Ordovician (950 species). In the
Silurian, though they were still common, the trilobites
were nevertheless on the decline (485 species),
and this ebbing of their vital force is seemingly
shown in many picturesque forms replete with
protuberances, spines, and exaggeration of parts.
As a rule, in evolution, one finds that when
an organic stock is losing its vital force there
arises in it an exaggeration of parts, as if heroic
efforts were being made to maintain the race. Spinosity
in animals is often the prophecy of tribal
death. In the Devonian, the variety and number of
the trilobites were greatly reduced (105 species),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">» 278 «</a></span>
at a time when the ancient types of fishes, which
undoubtedly fed on these crustaceans (trilobites),
began to be common in the seas. In the
later Paleozoic seas, the trilobites were relics,
or animals surviving from a time better suited
to their needs, and one by one they vanished,
until a little before the close of the Paleozoic era
none were left." (Schuchert.)</p>

</div>

<p>An extraordinary type of Arthropod which
ranged throughout Paleozoic time and became extinct
at its close was the so-called &ldquo;sea scorpion,&rdquo;
closely related to the modern scorpion. Their five
or six pairs of appendages all came out from the
head portion, one pair in some cases having been
developed as powerful pincers. Their culmination
in size was reached during the Devonian when some
forms grew to the astonishing length of over eight
feet! Such gigantic creatures must have been
tyrants of the seas until they were subdued by the
oncoming powerful fishes. True scorpions are
known from rocks as old as the Silurian. Lobsters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">» 279 «</a></span>
and crabs made their appearance during the Mesozoic
era.</p>

<p>Since insects constitute the highest subdivision
of Arthropods, they include the very highest forms
of animal life except the Vertebrates. The oldest
known fossil insects are from Pennsylvanian strata,
more than 1,000 species having been described from
rocks of that age. They were all simple or primitive
types like cockroaches and dragon flies, and
were remarkable for size. Giant cockroaches got
to be four inches long. One form of dragon fly,
with a spread of wing of over two feet, was probably
the largest insect which ever lived (<a href="#Plate_15a">Plate 15</a>).
Development of insect life was especially favored
during the great Coal Age because of the prolific
vegetation, but more than likely insects originated
somewhat earlier. Early in the Mesozoic era a
great progressive change began to come over insect
life and higher forms gradually evolved until by the
close of the era many of the highest types like flies,
ants, and bees were common. As might be expected,
the highest insects did not develop until after the
appearance of the true flowering plants in later
Mesozoic time, butterflies apparently not having
evolved until early in Cenozoic time. Many of the
thousands of known species of fossil insects are
from strata of Tertiary age during which time they
may have been even more numerous than to-day,
although there are about 400,000 species now living.
An almost incredible case is a Tertiary stratum only
a few feet thick in Switzerland from which nearly
1,000 species of insects have been unearthed. Another
famous locality is Florissant, Colorado, where
during early Tertiary time there was a small lake
into which showers of fine volcanic dust fell and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">» 280 «</a></span>
entombed vast numbers of insects, more than 2,000
species having been unearthed. Still another extraordinary
occurrence is along the shores of the
southern Baltic Sea where more than 2,000 species
of insects have been found in a fossil resin called
amber. The insects were caught in the still soft
sticky resin while it was exuding from the trees, and
thus we have the insects, fully two or three million
years old, literally embalmed and marvelously preserved,
often in beautifully transparent amber.</p>

<p class="caption3">GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF VERTEBRATE ANIMALS (INCLUDING MAN)</p>

<div class="dropcap">V</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">V</span>ERTEBRATES comprise the highest subkingdom
of all animals with man himself at the very
top. They are characterized by the possession of a
vertebral column, which, in all but the very simple
or primitive forms, is an ossified backbone. Their
main subdivisions are given in the classification
table near the beginning of the preceding chapter.
The oldest known Vertebrates, found in fossil form
in middle Ordovician strata, were represented by
curious and bizarre creatures called ostracoderms,
or more popularly &ldquo;armor fishes.&rdquo; They were not
true fishes because they were really somewhat lower
in the scale of organization than fishes. Some were
distinctly fishlike in appearance, and others notably
resembled certain of the Arthropods, so that some
students consider them to have formed the connecting
link between the highest Invertebrates (Arthropods)
and low order fishes of the Vertebrates.
The vertebral column always consisted of cartilage
or gristle and, in most forms, it extended through
tail fin. None had true side fins like fishes, but
many were provided with a pair of jointed flappers
or paddles. The jawlike portions of the heads
moved over each other sidewise as, for example, in
beetles and not up and down in true Vertebrate
fashion. Two eyes were always very close together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">» 282 «</a></span>
One of the most striking features was the protection
of the head and fore part of the body by an armor
of bony plates, while the rest of the body had scales.
They seldom grew to be more than six or seven
inches long. Beginning in the Devonian, they remained
rare during the Silurian, and then in the
Devonian period they reached their climax of development
only to become extinct at its close. Many
species were abundantly represented in many parts
of the world. By some the Ostracoderms are
thought to have been a primitive (sharklike) fish
development in the wrong direction, and hence they
became extinct.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 452px;">

types of Vertebrates called &ldquo;ostracoderms.&rdquo; They were lower
in organization than true fishes. (After Dean-Woodward and British
Museum, respectively.)</div>
</div>

<p>Fishes, represented only by very primitive sharks,
are known to have existed as early as the Silurian
period, but the remains are scant. During the Devonian
period, however, they showed a marvelous
development into many species and countless myriads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">» 283 «</a></span>
of individuals. The Devonian is, therefore,
commonly called the &ldquo;Age of Fishes.&rdquo; These very
ancient (Devonian) primitive (fish) types of Vertebrate
animal life are of profound significance in
organic evolution because they were the direct progenitors
of the great groups of still higher Vertebrates
which since later Paleozoic time gradually
increased in diversity and complexity of structure
through amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals
finally to man himself.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 421px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span>&mdash;Restorations of characteristic Devonian fishes, based upon
actual fossils: a, a &ldquo;lung fish&rdquo; with leglike fins (after Huasakof); b,
a &ldquo;ganoid.&rdquo; (After Nicholson.)</div>
</div>

<p>In marked contrast to the most typical and highly
organized fishes so abundant to-day, all Devonian
fishes were of simple types with cartilaginous
skeletons and vertebrated tails. Many of them
were also generalized types, that is, associated with
their clearly defined fish characters were others
connecting them with certain higher Vertebrates,
as, for example, amphibians and reptiles. Thus all
their tail fins were vertebrated as in reptiles; their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">» 284 «</a></span>
labyrinthine, internal tooth structure was to be an
amphibian feature when those creatures evolved;
many had protective armor or bony scales like most
early amphibians and many modern reptiles; and
many had paired fins which were something like
jointed legs. Most abundant and highly organized
of the Devonian fishes were &ldquo;ganoids,&rdquo; characterized
by a covering of small plates or bony scales set together
but not overlapping like in typical modern
fishes. Their intricate tooth structure and limblike
fins strongly suggest the amphibians of later Paleozoic
time. The skeleton of cartilage gradually became
somewhat ossified during succeeding geologic
periods. From their great profusion and diversity
in the Devonian period the ganoids have steadily
fallen away until they now have very few descendants
like the gar pike.</p>

<p>Another important group of remarkable fishes,
now totally extinct, but common in Devonian and
somewhat later time, had heavy, bony armor plates
over the fore part of the body. Those which grew
to be fifteen to twenty-five feet long were probably
the rulers of the middle Paleozoic seas. Another remarkable
Devonian fish was able to breathe in both
water and air because, like their few modern descendants,
they had both gills and lungs. Because of
their leglike fins and lung sac, it is commonly believed
that they were progenitors of the later Paleozoic
amphibians. The simplest of all fishes, the
sharks, began in the Silurian, underwent no important
change through the millions of years since,
and are now of course well represented. During
early Cenozoic time the sharks seem to have reached
culmination in size&mdash;sixty to eighty feet long, with
teeth five or six inches long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">» 285 «</a></span></p>

<p>Among modern fishes the most abundant by far,
and the most highly organized, are the true bony
fishes, called the &ldquo;teleosts,&rdquo; which made their first
appearance in the middle of the Mesozoic era. Those
earliest forms clearly show their descent from the
ganoids. Apparently they have not yet passed their
prime.</p>

<p>We shall now consider the next higher group of
Vertebrates, the amphibians, which breathe by gills
when young and later develop lungs. Many live
both on land and in water like the frogs. Unlike
fishes they have legs with toes and not fins. Beginning
probably in the Devonian as a branch of the
fishes, amphibians showed a marvelous development
during later Paleozoic and very early Mesozoic
times when they reached their climax, after which
they fell off remarkably, being now relatively unimportant
like the frogs and salamanders. They are
of special significance because they were the first
of all the back-boned animals (Vertebrates) to inhabit
the land which they dominated only until the
great rise of reptiles of Mesozoic time. The reptiles
in fact evolved from the amphibians in the late
Paleozoic when many transition forms occurred.
(<a href="#Plate_15a">Plate 15.</a>) During those ancient days the numerous
and very diversified amphibians were like giant salamanders,
commonly five to eight feet long, with one
Triassic form fifteen to twenty feet long, and with
heavily armored skulls two to four feet long.</p>

<p>Turning now to the reptiles we find that they are
much more distinctly land animals than the preceding
types of Vertebrates. Reptilian life of the earth
began in late Paleozoic time as an evolutionary
branch of the amphibians. The earliest forms were
in many ways much like the amphibians, but gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">» 286 «</a></span>
they diversified and progressed so that before
the close of the Mesozoic era, which has long
been called the &ldquo;Age of Reptiles,&rdquo; they were the
rulers of the world. &ldquo;They covered the land with
gigantic herbivorous and carnivorous forms; they
swarmed in the sea, and, as literal dragons, they
dominated the air.&rdquo; (Scott.) Mesozoic reptiles are
of special interest and significance not only in themselves,
but also because from one of their branches
the birds were evolved, and from another the mammals.
&ldquo;In advancing from the amphibian to the
reptile the evolution of the Vertebrates was far
from finished. The cold-blooded, clumsy and sluggish,
small-brained and unintelligent reptile is as
far inferior to the higher mammals, whose day was
still to come, as it is superior to the amphibian and
the fish.&rdquo; (Norton.)</p>

<p>Since the reptiles of the Mesozoic era constitute one
of the few most remarkable and diversified classes of
animals which ever inhabited the earth, we shall attempt
to give the reader a fair idea of the most typical
groups which have been totally extinct since the
close of the Mesozoic era some millions of years ago.
Of the swimming reptiles which lived in the seas
many types are known and only a few will be described.
Among these one important type was the
ichthyosaur, a fishlike form which not uncommonly
grew to be twenty to even forty feet long (<a href="#Plate_18a">Plate 18</a>).
The large head, sometimes four or five feet long,
contained as many as 200 big sharp teeth and
enormous eyes up to a foot in diameter. The body
was heavy set, and the neck very short. There were
four short, stout swimming paddles, and the tail was
vertebrated. Some specimens of ichthyosaurs have
been so perfectly preserved in Mesozoic strata
that even the unborn young are plainly seen in the
bodies! In some cases it is actually possible to tell
what was the last meal of a particular ichthyosaur
those millions of years ago; in one specimen, for
example, remains of 200 creatures of the &ldquo;cuttle-fish&rdquo;
tribe having been found in the exact position
of the stomach.</p>

<p>The mosasaurs of the late Mesozoic were the only
real sea serpents of the geologic ages. They were
something like the ichthyosaurs, but with smaller
heads and much longer, more slender, serpentlike
bodies. Some grew to be thirty or forty feet long.</p>

<p>Plesiosaurs were perhaps the strangest of all the
Mesozoic marine reptiles. They grew to be forty to
fifty feet long, with stout body, very long, slender
neck, small head, short tail, and four long, powerful
swimming paddles which were distinctly leglike.
These and the mosasaurs were both flesh eaters, as
shown by the sharp teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">» 289 «</a></span></p>

<p>The most remarkable walking reptiles of all time
were the dinosaurs or &ldquo;terrible lizards.&rdquo; We shall describe
enough types of these unique creatures to give
the reader a fair idea of their appearance and habits.
Most astonishing of all were the sauropods including
the largest animals which ever trod the earth. They
grew to be as much as sixty to ninety feet or more
in length. Remarkably well preserved skeletons have
been found, one from Utah, eighty-seven feet long, being
mounted in the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh.
The largest of these brutes stood fifteen to twenty
feet high and they must have weighed thirty to
fifty tons. The very long, serpentlike neck and tail,
and very small head were grotesque features. Considering
the structure of the dinosaurs, the kind of
strata in which they are embedded, and the associated
fossil remains, it seems clear that they mostly
lived in and near fresh water and on near-by lowlands.
The character of their teeth shows that they
fed entirely on soft plants which they must have
habitually bolted because their teeth were not well
adapted to grinding food. It is difficult to believe
that a single huge beast could have consumed less
than a few hundred pounds of vegetable matter per
day, and, on account of the very small size of the
head, he must have spent most of his time eating.
Also the comparatively very small size of the brain,
and its simplicity of structure, render it certain that
they were extremely stupid creatures. &ldquo;To make
up for this they had an enormous enlargement of
the spinal cord in the sacral region (i.e., over the
hind legs). This sacral brain&mdash;if we may so call it&mdash;was
ten to twenty times bigger than the cranial
brain. It was necessary in order to work the
powerful hind legs and tail.&rdquo; (Le Conte.)</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 461px;">

mounted skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History, New
York, is sixty-seven feet long. This creature lived millions of years ago
during the Jurassic period. (After Marsh.)</div>
</div>

<p>Another dinosaur, in some respects like the sauropod,
was the stegosaur which grew to be twenty to
thirty feet long, and heavier than the elephant. Unlike
the sauropod, it had a short neck and was
armored with a double row of great plates over its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">» 290 «</a></span>
back, and sharp spines (one to three feet long) toward
the end of the tail. The excessive stupidity of
the creature is proved by the fact that its very simple
brain weighed less than three ounces! Stegosaurs
were plant eaters as indicated by the tooth structure,
and, though they looked ferocious, they were
probably not fighters, certainly at least nothing like
the carnivorous types of dinosaurs we shall soon
describe.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 367px;">

</div>

<p>The ferocious dinosaurs of Mesozoic time were
carnivorous, or flesh eaters, as shown by their numerous
sharp teeth in relatively large heads. The
largest known type is the tyrannosaur, an almost
perfect skeleton of which, 40 feet long and 16 feet
high, is mounted in the American Museum of Natural
History in New York (<a href="#Plate_17">Plate 17</a>). So far as
known, this was the largest carnivorous animal
which ever walked on the earth. It is evident from
the structure that it walked on its hind legs, the
front ones having been much shorter and used something
like arms. There were also various other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">» 291 «</a></span>
smaller forms of two-legged flesh-eating dinosaurs,
many of the wonderfully preserved tracks in the
Triassic sandstones of the Connecticut River Valley
having been made by such creatures when they
walked around over soft, sandy mud flats at least
eight or ten million years ago. The sandy mud
with its tracks became somewhat hardened and
then deeply buried under much more sediment
which, through the ages, has been eroded off, thus
exposing to view certain of the layers covered with
tracks. Some bones of dinosaurs have also been
found in the Connecticut Valley.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 356px;">

Mesozoic era. This type of plant eater grew to be fully twenty-five feet
long. (After Marsh.)</div>
</div>

<p>Another remarkable type of two-legged dinosaur
was much like the flesh eaters just described, but
they were plant eaters. The largest of these grew
to be 30 feet long and 15 to 20 feet high, comparable,
therefore, to the tyrannosaur in size. A
wonderful collection of almost perfect skeletons
may be seen in the museum in Brussels, Belgium.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">» 292 «</a></span>
In mining coal 1,000 feet below the surface in
Belgium, twenty-two complete skeletons and several
partial skeletons were found in an ancient river
deposit of Cretaceous Age. A marvelously preserved
specimen of one of these two-legged plant eaters
found in Wyoming, has been called a &ldquo;dinosaur
mummy&rdquo; because the skin and much of the flesh
of the creature had shriveled down upon its bones.
The minutest details of the texture of its skin are
almost perfectly preserved.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 390px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>&mdash;Skeleton of a dinosaur (triceratops) with a large remarkable
head. This creature grew to be twenty-five feet long during Cretaceous
time. (After Marsh.)</div>
</div>

<p>Another type of dinosaur, so different from the
others, should be briefly described. This was triceratops,
or the &ldquo;three-horned face&rdquo; beast, so named because
of the three powerful horns which projected
forward from the top of the very large, flattened
skull. It grew to be twenty to twenty-five feet long.
Skulls six to eight feet long have been unearthed.
Just where the brain might have developed, the
skull dished downward, and so one authority considers
triceratops to have had the largest head and
smallest brain of all the great reptiles.</p>

<p>It is well known that dinosaurs of many types
lived during the great &ldquo;Age of Reptiles,&rdquo; though
by no means all types ranged through the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">» 293 «</a></span>
era. No dinosaurs are definitely known to have
crossed the line into the Cenozoic era. One of the
most astonishing facts in the history of animal life
is the extinction of the mighty dinosaurs, but no
very satisfactory explanation has yet been offered.
Probably their great size was a contributing factor,
for it is well known &ldquo;that while very large animals
spend nearly all their time in eating, small animals
spend a small proportion of theirs, and most of it
in other activities. Now, as long as food is abundant,
the larger animals of a race have the better
chances, but if a scarcity of food ensues, the larger
animals may all be suddenly swept out of existence.&rdquo;
(Matthew.) Whatever may have been the real
reason for dinosaur extinction we can at least be
sure &ldquo;that with the extensive changes in the elevation
of land areas (Rocky Mountain Revolution)
which mark the close of the Mesozoic, came the withdrawing
of the great inland Cretaceous seas along
the low-lying shores of which the dinosaurs had
their home, and with the consequent restriction
of old haunts, came the blotting out of a heroic
race. Their career was not a brief one, for the duration
of their recorded evolution was twice that of
the subsequent mammalian (Cenozoic) age. They
do not represent a futile attempt on the part of
nature to people the world with creatures of insignificant
moment, but are comparable in majestic
rise, slow culmination, and dramatic fall to the
greatest nations of antiquity.&rdquo; (Schuchert.)</p>

<p>Among the most extraordinary animals not only
of the Mesozoic, but also of all time, were the flying
reptiles or literal dragons of the air. Some were very
small, while others were the largest creatures which
ever flew, with a spread of wing of twenty to twenty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">» 294 «</a></span>
feet&mdash;twice that of any modern bird. Unlike
birds they had no feathers, but the two wings consisted
of large membranes (batlike) supported by one
enormously elongated finger of each front limb. The
other fingers were armed with sharp claws. The
early Mesozoic flying reptiles had sharp teeth, while
the later ones were mostly entirely toothless, but all
were carnivorous. Their short bodies were supplied
with tails of varying lengths, one long-tailed
species having a rudder at the end. Their heads
were fairly large, but of light build. The creature
called &ldquo;pteranodon&rdquo; was not only the largest of the
flying reptiles, but also probably the most highly
specialized creature which ever lived, everything
possible apparently having been sacrificed to facilitate
flight (<a href="#Plate_18a">Plate 18</a>). The hollow bones were so
wonderfully light and strong that it has been estimated
that the living animal, with twenty-five foot
spread of wing, and head four feet long, could not
have weighed more than twenty-five pounds! The
rear portions of the body and hind limbs were very
weak.</p>

</div>

<p>It should not be thought that the above-described
groups of reptiles were the only ones which existed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">» 295 «</a></span>
during Mesozoic time. There were also certain
groups still living, like turtles, lizards, and crocodiles,
but they were doubtless mostly completely
under the dominance of certain of the now long-extinct
types above described. The oldest-known
fossil snakes are from very late Mesozoic rocks,
where they are small and comparatively rare.
More than likely they evolved from lizards by
deterioration of the legs. Poisonous snakes were
not evolved until early in the next (Cenozoic) era.</p>

<p>We shall now turn our attention to next to the
highest class of Vertebrate animals&mdash;the birds.
They and the mammals are the only warm-blooded
animals. What is their ancestry? From what
original stock did they branch off? The oldest-known
bird lived during the Jurassic period, and it
was so decidedly reptilian in character as to render
it practically certain that birds are specialized
descendants of certain Mesozoic reptiles, though not,
as might be supposed, of the flying reptiles. The
few known specimens of the Jurassic birds were
found in the famous lithographic limestone quarries
of Bavaria. At least two of the specimens are
in a marvelous state of preservation, with practically
the whole skeleton intact and almost perfect
impressions of the feathers on the rock. That the
creature was really a bird is proved not only by its
feathers, but also its beak, brain, limb bones, and
feet. Among the reptilian characters are its long,
vertebrated tail, teeth set in sockets, and long claws
on the wings. This reptilian bird was about the
size of a small crow.</p>

<p>By late Cretaceous time the birds made notable
evolutionary progress and they became diversified,
more than thirty species being known from Cretaceous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">» 296 «</a></span>
rocks. These were distinctly more modern
in structure and appearance than the Jurassic bird.
The only important reptilian characteristic still
retained was the possession of teeth. The tail had
become much shortened and the brain was still
relatively smaller than in modern birds. One type,
about nine inches high, was a powerful flier, as shown
by the strong keel and wing bones. Another important
Cretaceous type was almost wholly a water
dweller, with powerfully developed legs used in
swimming. Its teeth were set in grooves instead of
in sockets, thus indicating degeneration of tooth
structure. This type was notable for its size&mdash;five
to six feet in length.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 299px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">» 297 «</a></span></p>

<p>During the early part of the Cenozoic era birds
became still more advanced and numerous, with
many modern groups represented. Some of the
more primitive types were, however, still left over
during the Tertiary, as, for example, a toothed bird,
in which the teeth were merely dentations of the
bill, thus being the most degenerate of all types of
tooth structure.</p>

<p>Mammals comprise the highest class of all animals.
They are, of course, all warm blooded and
characterized by suckling their young. So far as
known, mammal life began in the early Mesozoic
era as a branch of primitive reptiles, but they made
little progress throughout the era when they occupied
a very subordinate position in the animal
world. They were few in number, small, and primitive
in structure. There is no evidence for the
Mesozoic existence of any of the higher forms of
mammals, that is, those which give birth to well-formed
young which are prenatally attached to the
mother by the so-called placentum. &ldquo;During the
eons of the Mesozoic, from late Triassic time until
its close, the mammals (including the remote progenitors
of humanity) were in existence, but held in
such effective check (by reptiles) that their evolutionary
progress was practically insignificant. This
curb is strikingly illustrated by the wonderful series
of tiny jaws and teeth of these diminutive creatures
found in the Comanchian (early Cretaceous) of
Wyoming, in actual association with the single tooth
of a carnivorous dinosaur, many times the bulk
of the largest mammalian jaw. The removal of
this check resulted (in the Tertiary period) in
the speedy evolution of the archaic mammals.&rdquo;
(Schuchert.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">» 298 «</a></span></p>

<p>The phenomenal development of mammals during
the Tertiary period forms one of the most wonderful
chapters in the whole evolution of organisms.
Even very early in the Tertiary, many important
higher (placental) types of mammals had evolved,
and the simpler, more primitive Mesozoic forms
became very subordinate. By the close of the Tertiary
the higher types of mammals had become marvelously
differentiated into most of the present-day
groups or types. A very significant feature of the
evolution was the steady increase in relative size
of brain. The vast numbers of fossil skeletons
and bones of mammals found in Tertiary strata
is scarcely believable. In our brief discussion
we can do no more than describe a few representative
examples of the Cenozoic evolution of
mammals.</p>

<p>The great diversity of modern placental animals
may be suggested by a few examples, as the tiger,
dog, horse, camel, elephant, squirrel, hedgehog,
whale, monkey, and man. Forms like these, traced
back through their ancestors to the very early part
of the Tertiary period, gradually become less and
less distinct until they cannot be at all distinguished
as separate groups, but rather there are ancestral
generalized forms which show combinations of features
of the later groups. Those early Tertiary
generalized placental mammals had four feet of
primitive character, with five toes on each foot; the
whole foot, which from toe to heel touched the
ground, was not adapted to swift running; the
teeth were simple (primitive) in type and of
full original number (forty-four); the toes were
supplied with nails which were about intermediate
between real claws and hoofs in structure;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">» 299 «</a></span>
and the brain was relatively much smaller
and simpler in structure than in most modern
mammals.</p>

of the horse family through several million years of the present
(Cenozoic) era of geologic time. (After Matthew, American Museum
of Natural History.)</div>
</div>

<p>The history of the horse family furnishes an excellent
illustration of certain evolutionary changes
among mammals. Skeletons of many species, ranging
from the early Tertiary to the present, have
been found in remarkable state of preservation representing
every important change in the history of
the horse family. A study of the chart will make
clear some of the most striking changes which have
taken place. The oldest member of the horse family
represented on the chart was about the size of a
small fox, with four toes and a degenerated fifth
toe (splint) on the front foot, and three toes and
splint on the hind foot. Since the chart was made
a still more primitive form, even more closely resembling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">» 300 «</a></span>
the original five-toed ancestor, has been
found. Gradually the middle toe enlarged, while
the others disappeared except the two splints or
very degenerate toes still left in the modern horse.
Increase in size of the animal and brain capacity
accompanied these changes. Also the teeth underwent
notable change, and two originally separate
bones (radius and ulna) of the foreleg became consolidated
into a single stronger bone.</p>

<p>The even-toed hoofed mammals of to-day, like the
deer, pig, and camel, are also the product of evolution
much like that of the horse, except that two of
the original five toes have been equally developed,
while the others have either greatly degenerated,
as in the pig, or disappeared entirely, as in the
camel.</p>

<p>The elephants, or trunk-bearing animals, illustrate
a very different kind of evolution. They seem
to have reached their climax of development in the
late Tertiary when they grew to be as much as 14
feet high, and were more abundant and widespread
over the earth than at any other time. The modern
elephant, like the horse, has been traced back
through many intermediate forms to its primitive
early Tertiary ancestry. Some of the most important
evolutionary changes took place in the head portion.
The trunk is a highly developed form of snout,
the earliest form of which was much like that of the
modern tapir. The tusks are highly specialized and
elongated teeth. During the earlier history the chin
was very long and supported short tusks, so that
there were then four tusks.</p>

<p>Carnivorous mammals, like tigers and wolves, and
gnawers, like rats and squirrels, may also be
traced back to generalized early Tertiary types.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">» 301 «</a></span></p>

<p>Another kind of evolution is well illustrated by
certain mammals which, even in early Tertiary
time, so thoroughly adapted themselves to a water
environment as to become whales, porpoises, etc.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 357px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>&mdash;Comparison of feet of monkeys and man.</div>
</div>

<p>The primates include the highest group of all
Vertebrates, and therefore of all animals. Monkeys,
apes, and man belong to the primates. There is no
evidence whatever for the appearance of even the
simplest and most primitive forms before the opening
of the Cenozoic era, but even very early in Tertiary
time, lemurs and primitive types of monkeys
existed. Later in the Tertiary true monkeys and
apes were common, and by the close of the period
some apes were highly enough developed to strongly
resemble certain of the oldest and most primitive
types of man. We have, however, no positive
knowledge of the existence of man in even the latest
Tertiary. In the light of much evidence in regard
to the antiquity of man, it seems improbable that
true human fossils will ever be found in rocks older
than the Quaternary, though if we are willing to
descend (far enough in the human scale toward
apes) it is not unlikely that man-apes may be discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">» 302 «</a></span>
in very late Tertiary rocks. The difficulty
comes in the classification. Where are we to draw
the line between the higher apes and the lowest
forms of man? But this very difficulty is one of
the strongest arguments in favor of the organic
evolution of man because practically all intermediate
forms between true man and certain other high-grade
primates are known from the strata. The
following tabular summary of the geological history
of man is based upon the work of most of the ablest
students of the subject.</p>

<p>Of the early ancestral forms, that is, those which
were rather distinctly man-apes, two will be very
briefly referred to. One of these, known as <i>Pithecanthropus
erectus</i>, was a remarkable creature whose
partial skeleton, consisting of the upper part of a
skull, lower jaw, several teeth, and a thigh bone, was
found in early Quaternary deposits in Java in 1891.
It was certainly a man-ape or possibly ape-man of
low order, about 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet high. The skull has a low
crown, very receding forehead, and prominent brow
ridges, but the brain capacity is 850 cubic centimeters,
as compared to 500 cubic centimeters in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">» 303 «</a></span>
ordinary higher apes, and nearly 1,500 cubic centimeters
in the average modern man. The very recently
extinct very low-type aborigines of Tasmania
had a skull capacity of 1,199 cubic centimeters.</p>

<p>In 1907 the lower jaw of an anthropoid or manlike
ape set with rather human teeth was found associated
with very crude stone implements seventy-five
feet below the surface in river-deposited sand in Germany.
It is of either early or middle Glacial time
and quite certainly represents a lower order creature
than the oldest Paleolithic man as described below.</p>

<p>Many bones and implements of Paleolithic man
(see <a href="#Page_302">above table</a>) have been found mainly in river
gravels and caves. The relative ages of Paleolithic
human bones and implements are best determined
by the associated fossil animals. Thus the most
ancient truly human fossils are found directly associated
with bones of very old types of elephants,
rhinoceroses, and hippopotamuses which are definitely
known to have lived during middle or early
middle Glacial (Quaternary) time corresponding to
early Paleolithic time. A very conservative estimate
would make the age of such very old human remains
at least 150,000 to 250,000 years because the Ice
Age was at least 500,000 years long. In a later
human stage there are many associations with extinct
animals like an older type of mammoth, cave
bear, cave hyena, and others of later Glacial time
estimated at 50,000 to 150,000 years ago. Last of
all was the latest Paleolithic stage corresponding to
the close of the Ice Age, the human remains of
which are found associated with reindeer and the
latest mammoths which roamed in great numbers
across Europe. This was probably not more than
30,000 to 50,000 years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">» 304 «</a></span></p>

<p>Paleolithic man is so called because he fashioned
stone weapons and implements. The structure of
skull and skeleton shows him to have been a low-type
savage, something over five feet high on the average,
with a forward stooping carriage. The average
Paleolithic brain was not greatly inferior in size to
that of modern civilized man, but it was not so
highly organized and occupied a thick skull with
much lower forehead and heavy brow ridges. The
bushmen of Australia and the recently extinct Tasmanians
are the nearest modern resemblances.
Many fine specimens of Paleolithic man have been
found, especially in cave deposits. That he was an
expert hunter is proved by the great accumulation
of bones of now extinct animals found in and about
his haunts or camps, bones representing at least
100,000 horses having been found around a single
camp site!</p>

</div>

<p>Only two among the many known Paleolithic man
localities will be briefly described. In the Perigord
district of southwestern France a number of caves
contain human relics ranging in age from early to
late Paleolithic. Of special interest among these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">» 305 «</a></span>
relics are fishhooks made of bone, and crude
sketches of animals such as the mammoth and reindeer
now extinct in that region. The Aurignac cave,
also in France, was no doubt a family or tribal
burial place. Seventeen Paleolithic human skeletons,
associated with bones of extinct animals and
crude art works, were found in the cave. Near the
entrance there were ashes and charcoal mixed with
burned and split bones of extinct animals. Certain
of the caves occupied by late Paleolithic man have
their walls decorated with sketches and even colored
pictures. These are, therefore, the oldest known art
galleries. An excellent example is the cave at Altamira
in northern Spain. &ldquo;As we glance at the pictures
one of the first things to impress us is the
excellence of the drawing, the proportions and postures
being unusually good.... The next observation
may be that, in spite of this perfection of
technique, there is no perspective composition&mdash;that
is, no attempt to combine or group the figures....
It is also clear that the work of many different
artists is represented, covering a considerable period
of time. The walls show traces of many other
paintings that were erased to make way for new
work.&rdquo; (Wissler.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">» 306 «</a></span></p>

<p>The Neolithic, or &ldquo;recent stone&rdquo; age was a
gradual development from the late Paleolithic, and
man was then more highly developed and more similar
in structure to modern man. His stone implements
were more perfectly made, and often more or
less polished and ground at the edges. &ldquo;The remains
of Neolithic man are found, much as are
those of the North American Indians, upon or near
the surface, in burial mounds, in shell heaps (the
refuse heaps of their settlements), in peat bogs,
caves, recent flood-plain deposits, and in beds of
lakes near shore where they sometimes built their
dwellings upon piles.... Neolithic man in
Europe had learned to make pottery, to spin and
weave linen, to hew timber, and build boats, and
to grow wheat and barley. The dog, horse, ox,
sheep, goat, and hog had been domesticated.&rdquo;
(Norton.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man is linked to the past through the system of
life, of which he is the last, the completing creation.
But, unlike other species of that closing system of
the past, he, through his spiritual nature, is more
intimately connected with the opening future.&rdquo;

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></p>

<p class="caption3">MINERALOGY</p>

<div class="dropcap">W</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">W</span>E are more or less familiar with the division
of all materials of nature into the animal,
vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. With slight exceptions
minerals are the materials which make up
the known part of the earth. In a very real sense,
then, mineralogy is the most fundamental of the various
branches of the great science of geology because
the events of earth history, as interpreted by the
geologist, are recorded in the mineral matter (including
most rocks) of the earth. When we examine
the rocky material or mineral matter of the earth in
any region we find that it consists of various kinds
of substances each of which may be recognized by
certain characteristics. Each definite substance
(barring those of organic origin) is called a mineral.
Or, more specifically, a mineral is a natural,
inorganic, homogeneous substance of definite chemical
composition. According to this definition a mineral
must be found ready made in nature, must not
be a product of life, must be of the same nature
throughout, and its composition must be so definite
that it can be expressed by a chemical formula. All
artificial substances, such as laboratory and furnace
products, are excluded from the category of minerals.
Coal is not a mineral because it is both
organic and of indefinite composition. A few examples
of very common substances which perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">» 308 «</a></span>
satisfy the definition of a mineral are quartz, feldspar,
mica, calcite, and magnetite. Only two substances&mdash;water
and mercury&mdash;are ordinarily liquid
minerals. There are nearly a thousand distinct
mineral species, and to them and their varieties
several thousand names have been applied.</p>

<p>It is a surprising fact that of the eighty or more
chemical elements, that is substances which cannot
be subdivided into simpler ones, only eight make up
more than 98 per cent of the weight of the crust of
the earth, though, with one very slight exception,
none of the eight exist as such in mineral form.
The eight elements are oxygen (nearly 50 per cent),
silicon (over 25 per cent), aluminum (over 7 per
cent), iron (over 5 per cent), calcium (or &ldquo;lime&rdquo;),
magnesium (or &ldquo;magnesia&rdquo;), sodium (or &ldquo;soda&rdquo;),
and potassium (or &ldquo;potash&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Certain rock formations are made up essentially
of but one mineral in the form of numerous grains
as, for example, limestone, which consists of calcite
(carbonate of lime). Most of the ordinary rocks
are, however, made up of two or more minerals
mechanically bound together. Thus, in a specimen
of granite on the author&rsquo;s desk several distinct
mineral substances are distinguishable by the naked
eye. These mineral grains are from one to five millimeters
across. Most common among them are
hard, clear, glassy grains called quartz; nearly
white, hard grains, with smooth faces, called feldspar;
small, silvery white plates, easily separable
into very thin flakes, called mica; and small, hard,
black grains, called magnetite. It is the business
of the mineralogist to learn the characters of each
mineral, how they may be distinguished from each
other, how they may be classified, how they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">» 309 «</a></span>
found in nature, and what economic value they may
have. It is an important part of the business of the
geologist to learn what individual minerals combine
to form the many kinds of rocks, how such
rocks originate, what changes they have undergone,
and what geological history they record. It is thus
clear that the great science of geology is much
broader in its scope than mineralogy.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable facts about minerals
is that most of them by far have a crystalline structure,
that is they are built up of tiny particles
known as molecules. Such crystalline minerals are
often more or less regular solid forms bounded by
plane faces and sharp angles, such forms being
known as &ldquo;crystals.&rdquo; How do crystals develop such
regularity of form? Any solid is considered to be
made up of many very tiny (submicroscopic) molecules
held together by an attractive force called
cohesion. In liquids the molecules may more or less
freely roll over each other, thus altering the shape
of the mass without disrupting it. In gases the
molecules are considered to be relatively long distances
apart and moving rapidly. During the
process of change of a substance from the condition
of a liquid or gas to that of a solid, due to lowering
of temperature or evaporation, the cohesive force
pulls the particles (molecules) together into a rigid
mass. Under favorable conditions such a solid has
a regular polyhedral form. "This results from the
fact that the particles or molecules of the substance
which, while it was liquid or gaseous, rolled about
on one another, have been in some way arranged,
grouped and built up. To illustrate this, suppose
a quantity of small shot to be poured into a glass:
the shot will represent the molecules of a substance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">» 310 «</a></span>
in the liquid state, as for example a solution of alum.
If, now, we suppose these same shot to be coated
with varnish or glue so that they will adhere to each
other, and imagine them grouped as shown in Figure
70a, they will represent the arrangement of the
molecules of the alum after it has become solid or
crystallized. This arranging, grouping, and piling
up of molecules is called crystallization, and the
solid formed in this way is called a crystal. Figures
70b and 70c show the shot arranged to reproduce
two common forms of crystals (e.g., fluorite and
calcite)." (Whitlock.)</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 451px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>&mdash;Piles of shot arranged to give some idea of the manner in
which molecules are bound together in various crystal forms. (After
Whitlock, New York Museum.)</div>
</div>

<p>A combination of certain facts regarding crystals
furnish all but absolute proof of some sort of regularity
of arrangement of particles within them.
Among such facts are the following: (1) the wonderful
regularity of arrangement of faces upon crystals
is practically impossible to account for except
as the outward manifestation of regularity of structure
or systematic network arrangement of the
interior; (2) most crystals split or cleave more or
less perfectly in one or more directions presumably
in accordance with certain layered structure of the
constituent particles; (3) all of the many known
forms of crystals can be accurately grouped in regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">» 311 «</a></span>
to their effects upon the passage of light
(especially polarized light) through them, each kind
or type of network structure presumably producing
a different effect upon light; and (4) X-ray photographs
have proved that particles, or at least groups
of particles, are very systematically arranged within
crystals.</p>

<p>It will be instructive for us to make a comparison
between the growth of crystals and organisms.
Both really grow, but each species of organism is
rather definitely limited in size while there is no
known limit to the size which may be attained by a
crystal so long as material is supplied to it under
proper conditions. As a matter of fact crystals
vary in size from microscopic to several feet in
length, those less than an inch in length being most
abundant by far. Organisms mostly grow from
within, while crystals grow from material externally
added. It is an astonishing fact that in crystals
as well as organisms growth takes most rapidly
on a wound or broken place. Thus if a crystal is
removed from the solution in which it is growing
and put back after a corner has been broken off,
the fractured surface will build up more rapidly
than the rest. Finally, crystals are not necessarily
limited in age like organisms. Under certain natural
conditions, as, for example, weathering, crystals
may decay or be broken up; but where they are
protected as constituent parts of rock formations
well below the earth&rsquo;s surface they may remain
unchanged for indefinite millions of years. Thus in
a ledge of the most ancient known or Archeozoic
rock only recently laid bare by erosion one may see
crystals which are precisely as they were when they
crystallized many millions of years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">» 312 «</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most remarkable properties of a crystal
is its symmetry, by which is meant the greater or
less degree of regularity in the arrangement of its
faces, edges, and vertices. A given substance may,
according to circumstances, crystallize in a variety
of forms or combinations of forms, but, with very
few exceptions, all crystals of a given substance
exhibit the same kind or grade of symmetry. There
are three kinds of crystal symmetry, namely, in
respect to a plane, a line or axis, and a point or
center. A plane of symmetry divides a crystal into
halves in such a way that for every point on one
side of the plane there is a corresponding point
directly opposite on the other side. Crystals may be
cut into halves along various surfaces which are not
symmetry planes. An axis of symmetry is a line
about which a complete rotation (or in a few cases
rotation combined with reflection) brings the crystal
into the same relative position two, three, four or
six times, these being called two, three, four, and
sixfold axes of symmetry&mdash;no others being possible.
A crystal has a center of symmetry when any line
passing through it encounters corresponding points
at equal distances from it on opposite sides. There
are just 32 classes or combinations of the symmetry
elements among crystals and just 232 definite
crystal forms. Not only is it demonstrable that no
more can exist, but actual experience with crystals
of hundreds of species of minerals has never
revealed any more. Obviously, then, symmetry
furnishes us with a very scientific basis of classification
of crystals, all of the 232 crystal forms constituting
the 32 symmetry classes being in turn
referable to seven fundamental crystal systems.
To bring out the relations of the faces of a crystal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">» 313 «</a></span>
and further aid in classification, prominent, straight
lines or directions passing through the center of a
crystal are chosen as crystallographic axes. Such
axes may or may not coincide with symmetry axes.
Basing our definitions upon both symmetry axes
and crystallographic axes, the seven systems are
as follows:</p>

<p>1. Isometric. There must be at least four threefold
axes of symmetry, while the highest grade
symmetry class of the five in the system includes
three fourfold, four threefold, and six twofold
axes of symmetry; nine planes of symmetry; and a
center of symmetry. There are three interchangeable
crystallographic axes at right angles to each
other.</p>

points of emergence of the nine axes of symmetry in a cube of the Isometric
system; c, nine planes of symmetry in a cubic crystal. (After
Whitlock, New York State Museum.)</div>
</div>

<p>2. Tetragonal. There must be one and only one
fourfold symmetry axis, while the highest of its
seven symmetry classes contains also four twofold
axes of symmetry; five planes; and a center. Characterized
by three crystallographic axes at right
angles to each other, only two of them interchangeable.</p>

<p>3. Trigonal. Characterized by one and only one
threefold symmetry axis, the highest of the five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">» 314 «</a></span>
classes having also three twofold axes; four
planes; and a center. Crystallographic axes as for
hexagonal.</p>

<p>4. Hexagonal. One and only one sixfold axis
of symmetry must be present, but the highest of the
seven classes also has six twofold axes; seven
planes; and a center. Characterized by four crystallographic
axes, one vertical and three interchangeable
horizontal axes making angles of 60
degrees with each other.</p>

<p>5. Orthorhombic. There must be no axis of
symmetry higher than a twofold and three prominent
directions (i.e., parallel to important faces)
at right angles to each other, the highest grade
of the three classes having three twofold axes;
three planes; and a center. There are three
noninterchangeable crystallographic axes at
right angles.</p>

<p>6. Monoclinic. There is no axis of symmetry
higher than a twofold and only two prominent
directions at right angles to each other, the highest
of the three classes having one twofold axis; one
plane; and a center. There are three noninterchangeable
crystallographic axes, only two of which
are at right angles.</p>

<p>7. Triclinic. There is no axis of symmetry of
any kind, and there are no prominent directions
at right angles. One of the two classes has a
center of symmetry only, and the other no symmetry
at all. Characterized by three noninterchangeable
crystallographic axes, none at right
angles.</p>

<p>A fact which should be strongly emphasized is
that crystals only, of all the objects of nature, can
be definitely referred to the above seven systems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">» 315 «</a></span>
comprising the 32 classes of symmetry, and 232
crystal forms. Since there are about 1,000 mineral
species and only 232 fundamental forms, it necessarily
follows that two or more species may crystallize
in the same form within a class, so that it is not
always possible to tell the species of mineral merely
by its crystal form. It is, however, a remarkable
fact that, where two or more substances crystallize
in the same class (i.e., show the same grade of
symmetry) each substance almost invariably
exhibits &ldquo;crystal habit&rdquo; which is a pronounced tendency
to crystallize in certain relatively few forms
or combinations of forms out of the many possibilities.
It is clear, then, that grade of symmetry combined
with &ldquo;habit&rdquo; are of great practical value in
determining crystallized minerals, because, on the
basis of symmetry, a crystal is referred to a certain
definite symmetry class in which only a limited
number of substances crystallize, and then, by its
characteristic &ldquo;habit,&rdquo; the particular substance can
be told.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 463px;">
<a name="Fig_72" id="Fig_72"></a><img src="images/fig72.png" width="463" height="142" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>&mdash;Figures illustrating three crystal forms with exactly the
same symmetry elements; a and b are separate forms, and c is a combination
of the two. The mineral &ldquo;garnet&rdquo; nearly always crystallizes
in one of these forms.</div>
</div>

<p>From the above discussion it should not be presumed
that crystals always develop with perfect
geometric symmetry. As a matter of fact such is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">» 316 «</a></span>
seldom the case because, due to variations of conditions
or interference of surrounding crystals in
liquids (ordinary or molten), a crystal usually
grows more rapidly (by building out faces) in certain
directions than in others. Under such conditions
actual crystals are said to become distorted
because they are not geometrically perfect.</p>

<p>Whether geometrically perfect or not, all crystals
respond to the law of constancy of interfacial angles
which means that on all crystals of the same substances
the angles between similar (corresponding)
faces are always equal. This is one of the most
fundamental and remarkable laws of minerals.
That it must be true follows from the fact that the
crystal faces merely outwardly express in definite
form the definite internal structure or arrangement
of particles which have built up the crystal. In
other words, the real structural symmetry of a crystal
never varies no matter how much its geometric
symmetry may vary. The practical application of
the law of constancy of interfacial angles lies in the
fact that in many cases a mineral may actually be
identified merely by measuring the interfacial angles
of its crystal form.</p>

<p>The relative lengths of the crystallographic axes
is a very important feature of all crystals except
those of the isometric system in which the axes are
always of equal length so that the ratio is 1:1:1.
In all the other systems, however, at least one axis
differs in length from the others and, since the
amount of difference is absolutely characteristic of
each substance, the axial ratio of a crystal, when
carefully determined by measurement of the
angles between the different faces, affords a
never-failing method of determining the mineral for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">» 317 «</a></span>
all systems except the isometric. By way of
illustration, the tetragonal crystal of the mineral
zircon, with only one axis different in length,
shows the very definite axial ratio 1:1:0.64, while
the orthorhombic crystal of sulphur, with all three
axes of different lengths, has an axial ratio
0.813:1:1.903. These ratios of course always
hold true no matter what the size or particular outward
form of the crystal.</p>

<p>As might be expected from the above discussion
of the remarkable structure of crystals, experience
has proved that the relative lengths of all intercepts
(or distances from the center) of all faces upon any
crystal can be expressed by whole numbers, definite
fractions, or infinity. It necessarily follows that the
ratios between the intercepts of the faces of any
face on a crystal to those of any other face on the
same crystal may always be expressed by rational
numbers, and this is known as the law of definite
mathematical ratio. It is a remarkable fact that
very small whole numbers or fractions, or infinity
or zero, will always express the intercepts of any
crystal face.</p>

<p>Thus far our discussion has centered about crystals
as individuals, but, in most cases by far, they
form groups or aggregates. Most commonly crystal
grouping is very irregular, but by no means rare is
parallel grouping where whole crystals, or more
usually parts of crystals, have all corresponding
parts exactly parallel. But most remarkable of all
are the twin crystals in which two or more crystals
intergrown or in contact have all corresponding
parts in exactly reverse order. The conditioning
circumstances under which twin crystals develop
are unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">» 318 «</a></span></p>

<p>In the light of the facts and principles above explained,
the reader will more than likely agree with
the author that crystals rank very high among nature&rsquo;s
most wonderful objects. But there are still
other characteristic features of crystals naturally
resulting from their marvelous structure. Some of
these will now be briefly referred to.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 457px;">
<a name="Fig_73" id="Fig_73"></a><img src="images/fig73.png" width="457" height="168" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span>&mdash;Figures illustrating twin crystals: a, gypsum (Monoclinic
system); b, fluorite (Isometric system); c, cassiterite (Tetragonal
system). (After New York State Museum Bulletin.)</div>
</div>

<p>Many crystals and crystalline substances exhibit
the important property known as cleavage which is
the marked tendency to break easily in certain directions
yielding more or less smooth plane surfaces.
As would be expected, a cleavage surface is always
parallel to an actual, or at least a possible, crystal
face, and it takes place along the surfaces of weaker
molecular cohesion. The degree of cleavage varies
from almost perfect, as in mica, to very poor or none
at all, as in quartz. The number of cleavage directions
exhibited by common minerals is illustrated
as follows: mica, one; feldspar, two; calcite, three;
and fluorite, four.</p>

<p>It is a striking fact that when a crystal or cleavage
piece is placed in a solvent, the action proceeds
with different velocities in crystallographically different
directions and little pits or cavities, called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">» 319 «</a></span>
etching figures, are developed on some or all of the
faces. Since the symmetry of these etching figures
and their arrangement upon the faces are directly
related to, and natural effects of the crystal symmetry,
the figures often furnish an important method
of placing a doubtful crystal or even merely a
cleavage fragment in its proper symmetry class.</p>

<p>Another marvelous property of crystals and crystalline
substances is their effect upon light. Since
the study of the passage of light through crystals
has really become a large separate branch of mineralogical
study, we can no more than state a few
fundamental facts and principles in the short space
at our disposal. Light is caused by vibrations of
the so-called &ldquo;ether,&rdquo; and always travels in straight
lines. The vibration directions are at right angles
to the direction of transmission of the light. When
a ray of light enters a crystal or crystalline mineral
representing any crystal system except the isometric
it is doubly refracted (i.e., broken into two rays),
each of the two rays is polarized (i.e., made to vibrate
in a single plane only), and one ray vibrates almost
at right angles to the other. Double refraction is
strikingly shown by placing a piece of clear calcite
(Iceland spar) over a dot on paper when two dots
instead of one are visible. The amount of double
refraction varies with the substance, and in some
degree according to the direction of passage of light
through a crystal. Isometric crystals only are
singly refracting and hence a ray of light is not
affected in passing through them. Crystals of all
the other six systems doubly refract and polarize
light and in three systems&mdash;tetragonal, hexagonal,
and trigonal&mdash;one direction (coincident with the
main axis of symmetry) produces single refraction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">» 320 «</a></span>
only, while in the remaining three systems&mdash;orthorhombic,
monoclinic, and triclinic&mdash;there are always
two directions of single refraction whose positions
vary with the substance. Many crystals outside the
isometric system also exhibit a remarkable tendency
to absorb light differently in different crystallographic
directions, thus producing two or three color
tints, which vary according to the substance. After
gaining a practical knowledge of the above and
many other optical properties of crystals, it is possible
by the aid of a specially constructed (polarizing)
microscope, to recognize (with few exceptions)
each one of the many mineral species. This method
is of great value in determining the various minerals
which are aggregated in the form of a rock,
in which case a very thin slice of the rock is studied
with the microscope.</p>

<p>An important criterion for the recognition of
minerals is hardness, by which is meant the resistance
of a smooth surface to abrasion or scratching.
The generally adopted scale of hardness follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">1.&mdash;Soft, greasy feel, and easily scratched by the finger nail (e.g., talc).</p>

<p class="blockquot">2.&mdash;Just scratched by the finger nail (e.g., gypsum).</p>

<p class="blockquot">3.&mdash;Just scratched by a copper coin (e.g., calcite).</p>

<p class="blockquot">4.&mdash;Easily cut by a knife, but does not cut glass (e.g., fluorite).</p>

<p class="blockquot">5.&mdash;Just scratches soft glass, and is cut by a knife (e.g., apatite).</p>

<p class="blockquot">6.&mdash;Harder than steel, and scratches glass easily (e.g., orthoclase).</p>

<p class="blockquot">7, 8, 9, and 10.&mdash;Harder than any ordinary substance and represented in order by quartz, topaz, corundum, and diamond.</p>

<p>Minerals also show a great variety of colors.
Many of them like quartz and calcite are colorless or
white, others like galena (steel-gray) and pyrite
(brass-yellow) show inherently characteristic colors,
while still others like amethyst (purple) and
sapphire (blue) are colored by impurities.</p>

<p>There is also a great range in relative weights or
density of minerals, commonly called the specific
gravity, which range from less than one for ice to
21.5 for platinum, and even somewhat higher. The
average specific gravity of all minerals of the earth
is about 2.6.</p>

<p>In the light of the above discussion of the general
properties of minerals, we shall now proceed to name
and briefly describe some of the minerals which are
either very common, or of special interest, or of
special economic importance. Only those features
are listed by which the mineral species may be
recognized at sight, or by the aid of very simple
nonchemical tests.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 479px;">
<a name="Fig_74" id="Fig_74"></a><img src="images/fig74.png" width="479" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>&mdash;Drawings showing forms of crystals of common minerals:
a and b, garnet (Isometric); c and d, feldspars (Monoclinic); e, f,
and g, quartz (Trigonal); h, i, and j, calcite (Hexagonal); k, augite
(Monoclinic); l. hornblende (Monoclinic); m, pyrite (Isometric).</div>
</div>

<p><a id="Amphibole"></a><span class="smcap">Amphibole.</span> A number of species closely related
in composition, crystal form, and properties are
here included. They are silicates of lime and magnesia
usually with aluminum and iron. Most common
by far are those which crystallize in the monoclinic
system with prismatic faces and two good
prismatic cleavages meeting at about 24 degrees.
Color, commonly brown to black, but sometimes
green or white. Hardness varies from 5 to 6, and
specific gravity from 3 to 3.4. <i>Hornblende</i>, the most
common species, is a dark colored silicate of lime,
magnesia, aluminum, and iron. It is one of the few
most common of all mineral species, especially in
igneous and metamorphic rocks. <i>Tremolite</i> is a
white to light gray silicate of lime and magnesia
found especially in metamorphic limestones. <i>Actinolite</i>
is a green silicate of lime, magnesia, and iron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">» 322 «</a></span>
especially common in certain metamorphic rocks.
One kind of jade is an amphibole similar to tremolite
and actinolite in composition, while the other
kind is a pyroxene (see <a href="#Pyroxene">below</a>). <i>Jade</i> is and has
been highly prized in the east (especially in China)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">» 323 «</a></span>
where it has been carved into many objects of exceptional
variety and beauty. Jade is probably the
toughest (not hardest) of all minerals because of its
wonderful microscopically fibrous structure. In
color it is white, gray, and green.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apatite.</span> Crystallizes in the hexagonal system
with a six-sided prism usually capped at each end
by a six-sided pyramid (see <a href="#Fig_75">Figure 75g</a>). Composition,
a phosphate of lime. Color variable, but mostly
white, green, or brown. Hardness of 5, or just
enough to scratch soft glass. Specific gravity, 3.2.
No good cleavage. Tiny crystals are widely disseminated
through many common rocks&mdash;igneous,
metamorphic, and sedimentary. In certain metamorphic
limestones excellent crystals a foot or more
in length have been found. Apatite, mostly in uncrystallized
form, is the source of most of our
phosphate fertilizers.</p>

<p><a id="Azurite"></a><span class="smcap">Azurite.</span> An azure-blue hydrous carbonate of
copper which crystallizes commonly in small monoclinic
crystals. Hardness, nearly 4, and specific
gravity, nearly 4. Commonly occurs in veins deposited
by underground water. One of the great ores
of copper, especially in Arizona, Chile, and Australia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barite.</span> A sulphate of barium crystallizing in
orthorhombic prisms usually of tabular habit.
White to light color shades. Hardness, 3.5; specific
gravity, 4.5, which is notably higher than the average
of light-colored minerals. Three good cleavages
parallel to principal crystal faces. A common and
widely distributed mineral, especially in many vein
deposits associated with certain ores. Used in
ground form to give weight to certain kinds of paper
and cloth, and a barium compound used for refining
sugar is made from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">» 324 «</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 509px;">

j, chalcopyrite (Tetragonal); k, fluorite (Isometric); l, zircon (Tetragonal);
m, tourmaline (Trigonal); n, corundum (Hexagonal).</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beryl.</span> A silicate of aluminum and the rare
chemical element beryllium. Hexagonal crystals
usually of very simple six-sided prismatic habit
(see <a href="#Fig_75">Figure 75c</a>). Color white, green, blue, or yellow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">» 325 «</a></span>
Specific gravity, 2.8. Cleavage practically
absent. It is a very exceptionally hard mineral,
being 8 in the scale. Very large crystals have been
found, as, for example, in New Hampshire, where
single crystals several feet long weigh a ton or
more. Beryl is also of special interest because two
of its varieties&mdash;<i>emerald</i> (green) and <i>aquamarine</i>
(blue)&mdash;are well-known gem stones, the emerald
being one of the most highly prized gems. The
colors are due to slight impurities. Beryl most
commonly occurs in dikes of coarse granite called
pegmatite, but also in certain metamorphic and
sedimentary rocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calcite.</span> Commonly called &ldquo;calc spar.&rdquo; A carbonate
of lime. Hexagonal crystals in a great variety
of forms, but all with crystal faces arranged in
sixes around the principal or vertical axis forming
rhombohedrons, prisms, or double-pointed pyramids.
The principal axis of symmetry is sixfold by a combination
of rotation and reflection. Very perfect
cleavages in three directions yielding fragments
whose faces make angles of 75 and 105 degrees.
Color, white when pure, but variously colored when
impure. Hardness, 3 (very easily scratched by a
knife); specific gravity, 2.7. Calcite is a very common
mineral, especially in limestone (including
<i>chalk</i>) and marble which are usually largely made
up of it. Also commonly found in veins, and as
spring and cave deposits (stalactites). A porous,
stringy variety, called <i>travertine</i>, is deposited by
certain hot springs, as at Mammoth Hot Springs in
Yellowstone Park. A very transparent crystalline
variety is called <i>Iceland spar</i>. Calcite is a very
useful mineral. Limestone and marble are widely
used as a building stone, and for decorative purposes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">» 326 «</a></span>
statuary, etc. Limestone is burned for quicklime,
used as a flux in smelting certain ores, in
glass making, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassiterite.</span> The one great ore of tin whose
composition is oxide of tin. Tetragonal crystallization
(<a href="#Fig_73">Figure 73c</a>). Hardness greater than steel, being
over 6 in the scale. Specific gravity 7, which is
notably high. Color, brown to nearly black. Cleavage,
practically absent. Fairly widespread in small
amounts, and in commercial quantities in only a few
localities, usually in veins in granite or metamorphic
rocks near granite, as at Cornwall, England, also in
the form of rounded masses in gravel deposition as
in the Malay region.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chalcocite.</span> Crystallizes in the orthorhombic
system, usually in tabular form, but crystals not
common. A black sulphide of copper with metallic
luster. Hardness, nearly 3; specific gravity, nearly
6. No cleavage. Chalcocite occurs in vein deposits
as one of the important copper ores, especially at
Butte, Montana.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chalcopyrite.</span> Known as &ldquo;copper pyrites,&rdquo;
(<a href="#Fig_75">Figure 75j</a>). A deep brass-yellow sulphide of iron
and copper. Seldom crystallized in tetragonal
forms. Hardness, 3.5; specific gravity, over 4. No
cleavage. Metallic luster. Widely distributed in
vein deposits associated with other metal-bearing
minerals. A very important ore of copper, especially
at Rio Tinto, Spain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chlorite.</span> A soft, green mineral, usually in
small tabular crystals, in general appearance much
like mica (see <a href="#Mica">below</a>), but unlike mica, the almost
perfect cleavage leaves are not elastic, though they
are flexible. Composition, a silicate of aluminum
and magnesia. Always of secondary origin as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">» 327 «</a></span>
result of chemical alteration of certain other minerals,
such as biotite-mica, pyroxene or amphibole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cinnabar.</span> A vermilion-red sulphide of mercury.
An extra soft metallic mineral, only 2.5 in the scale.
Specific gravity over 8, which is notably high. Completely
vaporizes on being heated. Small trigonal
crystals rare. Cinnabar is the one great ore of
mercury, occurring in veins, especially in California
and Spain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Copper.</span> Copper as such (so-called &ldquo;native copper&rdquo;)
is widely distributed in veins, usually in small
amounts with other copper minerals, but in the
great mines of northern Michigan it occurs in immense
quantities as the only important ore. It is
readily recognized by its color, softness (less than
3), and notable weight (specific gravity, nearly 9).
Isometric crystals uncommon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corundum.</span> An oxide of aluminum of hexagonal
crystallization, usually in six-sided prisms,
capped by very steep pyramidal faces (see <a href="#Fig_75">Figure
75n</a>). It is next to the hardest of all known minerals
(9 in the scale), the diamond only exceeding
it. Specific gravity about 4. Three good cleavages
making angles of nearly 90 degrees with each other.
The color of corundum is usually brown, but it
varies greatly. Two of the most highly prized of all
precious stones&mdash;<i>ruby</i> (red) and <i>sapphire</i> (blue)&mdash;are
nearly transparent varieties of corundum, colored
by certain impurities. <i>Oriental topaz</i> (yellow),
<i>oriental emerald</i> (green), and <i>oriental amethyst</i>
(purple) are also clear varieties of corundum. It
occurs in various igneous and metamorphic rocks,
and in some stream gravels. The finest rubies, associated
with some sapphires, occur in gravels in
Burma, Siam, and Ceylon. <i>Emery</i> is a fine-grained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">» 328 «</a></span>
mixture of corundum and other minerals, especially
magnetite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diamond.</span> This mineral is remarkable not only
because it is the king of precious stones, but also
because it is easily the hardest known substance
(10 in the scale). Specific gravity, 3.5. Very brilliant
luster. Crystals of usually octahedral habit in
the isometric system. Usually colorless, but often
variously tinted. Composition, pure carbon. Burns
completely away at high temperature. The greatest
mines in the world are in South Africa, where
the diamonds occur in masses of rather soft (decomposed)
igneous rock, evidently having crystallized
during the cooling of the molten masses. In Brazil
and India diamonds are found in stream gravels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feldspar Group.</span> The feldspars are by far the
most abundant of all minerals in the crust of the
earth. (Figures 74c, 74d.) There are several
important species or varieties of feldspar with
certain features in common as follows: crystal
forms, either monoclinic or triclinic (closely
resembling monoclinic), in prismatic forms whose
faces usually meet at or near 90 or 120 degrees;
two good cleavages at or near 90 degrees,
hardness at or near 6; specific gravity, a little
over 2.5; color, usually white, gray, or pink; and
composition, silicate of aluminum with potash, soda,
or lime. The two potash feldspars are <i>orthoclase</i>
and <i>microcline</i>, the former being monoclinic, with
cleavages at exactly 90 degrees, and the latter triclinic,
with cleavages a little less than 90 degrees.
A kind of green microcline is known as <i>Amazon
stone</i>. The soda-lime feldspars go by the general
name <i>plagioclase</i>. They are triclinic, with cleavages
meeting at approximately 86 degrees. Very commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">» 329 «</a></span>
one of the cleavage faces exhibits characteristic,
well defined striations or fine parallel lines caused by
multiple twinning during crystal growth. Some of
the common plagioclases are <i>albite</i>, a white soda feldspar,
including most so-called <i>moonstone</i>; <i>oligoclase</i>,
a usually greenish-white to reddish-gray soda-lime
feldspar including <i>sunstone</i>; and <i>labradorite</i>, a
lime-soda feldspar, usually gray to greenish-gray
with a beautiful play of colors. The feldspars occur
in all three great groups of rocks, but they have most
commonly crystallized during the cooling of molten
masses of igneous rocks. Where many sedimentary
rocks have undergone great change (metamorphism)
under conditions of heat, pressure, and
moisture, feldspars have very commonly formed.
Orthoclase and microcline feldspar are used in the
manufacture of porcelain and chinaware. Some
special varieties of feldspar are cut or polished for
semiprecious stones or decorative purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fluorite.</span> A common mineral whose composition
is fluoride of lime. (<a href="#Fig_73">Figure 73b.</a>) Isometric crystals,
usually cubes with edges modified, are common.
Twinned cubes are also common. Easily scratched by
a knife (hardness, 4), and specific gravity a little
over 3. Clear and colorless when pure, but variously
colored, especially green, blue, yellow, and brown, due
to impurities in solution during crystallization. Remarkable
because of its four good cleavages meeting
at such angles as to permit good cleavage octahedrons
to be broken out of crystals. Fluorite is widely
distributed, most commonly in vein deposits, often associated
with metallic ores. Occurs also as crystals
in some limestones and igneous rocks. Some fissure
veins of fluorite in limestone in southern Illinois
are twenty to forty feet wide. Used mostly as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">» 330 «</a></span>
flux in the manufacture of certain steel, in glass
making, and in making enamel ware.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Galena.</span> Commonly as isometric crystals either
as cubes or combinations of cubes and octahedrons.
Composition, sulphide of lead. (<a href="#Fig_75">Figure 75a.</a>) Color,
lead-gray with metallic luster. Hardness, 2.5;
specific gravity high, 7.5. Very brittle. Three excellent
cleavages at right angles and parallel to the
crystal faces of the cube. Nearly all of the lead of
commerce comes from the smelting of galena. It is
mined in many parts of the world where it nearly
always occurs in typical vein deposits often associated
with sphalerite (see <a href="#Sphalerite">below</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Garnet Group.</span> The members of this very interesting
mineral group very commonly occur in isometric
crystallized forms, mostly twelve and twenty-four
faced figures or both combined, as shown by
<a href="#Fig_72">Figure 72</a>. All the six species of garnets are silicates,
mostly of aluminum usually with either lime,
magnesia, or iron. Cleavage, very imperfect or
absent. Hardness great, 6.5 to 7.5, and specific
gravity 3.1 to 4.3, varying according to species.
Color also varies with composition, but most commonly
red, brown, and more rarely yellow, black,
and green. Garnets are most common as crystals
embedded in metamorphic rocks, especially highly
altered strata. Also occurs in many igneous rocks
and in some sands. Commonly used as a semiprecious
stone, and also ground for use as an abrasive,
especially in making a kind of sand (or garnet)
paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gold.</span> Gold as such (&ldquo;native gold&rdquo;) is, in small
amounts, really a very widely distributed mineral.
It is characterized by its yellow color, softness (less
than 3 in the scale), great weight (specific gravity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">» 331 «</a></span>
over 19), and extreme malleability. Most of the
commercial gold occurs in river gravels (so-called
&ldquo;placer deposits&rdquo;), and in veins associated with the
very common mineral quartz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Graphite.</span> Commonly called &ldquo;black lead,&rdquo; but it
is not lead at all. Its composition is pure carbon&mdash;the
same as that of the diamond. We here have a
very remarkable example of a single substance (carbon)
which, according to circumstances, crystallizes
in two distinctly different systems (diamond in
isometric, and graphite in hexagonal) yielding very
thin, flexible flakes; greasy in feel; and easily
rubs off on paper. It weighs less than the average
mineral (specific gravity, a little over 2). Good
crystals of hexagonal tabular form are rare. The
most natural home of graphite is in the metamorphic
rocks, especially certain of the highly altered
strata, where it occurs in the form of more or less
abundant flakes, having originated from organic
matter. Some also occurs in igneous rocks and in
veins. Large quantities are made at Niagara Falls
from anthracite by electricity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gypsum.</span> Monoclinic crystals common, usually of
simple forms, as shown by <a href="#Fig_75">Figure 75i</a>. Sometimes
twin crystals. Composition, sulphate of lime. Colorless
or white when pure. Can be scratched by the
finger nail (hardness, 2). Specific gravity, 2.3.
Three good cleavages, especially the prismatic, yielding
cleavage plates with angles of 66 and 114 degrees.
Thin cleavage layers, moderately flexible.
There are several varieties: (1) <i>selenite</i>, which is
clear, crystalline; (2) <i>satin spar</i>, fibrous with silky
luster; (3) <i>alabaster</i>, fine-grained and compact crystalline;
and (4) <i>rock gypsum</i>, massive granular or
earthy. Gypsum is common and widespread especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">» 332 «</a></span>
among stratified rocks often as thick beds which
have mostly resulted from evaporation of bodies of
water containing it in solution, and often associated
with salt beds. Also occurs as scattering crystals in
shales and clays, and in some veins. In greatest
quantities it is burned to make plaster of Paris.
Satin spar and alabaster are often cut and polished
for ornaments, etc. (See <a href="#Fig_73">Figure 73a</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halite.</span> Common salt. Composition, chloride of
soda. Isometric crystals, nearly always in cubes
with three good cleavages at right angles, and parallel
to the faces of the cube. Hardness, 2.5; specific
gravity, 2.5. Colorless to white when pure. Characteristic
salty taste. Abundant and widespread,
often as extensive strata in rocks of nearly all ages,
having resulted from evaporation of inland bodies
of salt water. Also in vast quantities in solution in
salt lakes and the sea. Halite has many uses, as for
example, cooking and preservative purposes, indirectly
in glass making and soap making, glazing
pottery, and in many ore-smelting and chemical
processes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hematite.</span>&mdash;One of the common and important
iron oxides with less iron than magnetite and no
water as has limonite. Crystallizes in hexagonal
forms. Color, black, with metallic luster, when crystalline,
otherwise usually dull red. Hardness, about
6; specific gravity, about 5. No cleavage. Red
streak when rubbed on rough porcelain. Hematite
is extremely widespread in rocks of all ages, especially
in metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Some
occurs as crystals in igneous rocks, and some in vein
deposits. It is the greatest ore of iron in the United
States, especially in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin,
and Alabama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">» 333 «</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kaolin.</span> Commonly called &ldquo;China clay.&rdquo; Composition,
a hydrous silicate of aluminum. Crystallizes
in scalelike monoclinic forms, but usually
forms compact claylike masses. Hardness, a little
over 2; specific gravity, 2.6. Color when pure,
white. Usually feels smooth and plastic. Very
abundant and widespread, especially forming the
main body of clay and of much shale. Always
of secondary origin, generally resulting from
the decomposition of feldspar. It is the main
constituent of chinaware, pottery, porcelain, tiles,
bricks, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Limonite.</span> An important oxide of iron in composition
like hematite except for its variable water
content. Never crystallized. Hardness, about 5;
specific gravity, nearly 4. Color, light to dark
brown to nearly black. Leaves a characteristic yellowish-brown
streak when rubbed on rough porcelain.
Exceedingly common and widely distributed,
always as a mineral of secondary origin as a product
of weathering of various iron-bearing minerals.
Where accumulated in considerable deposits it is an
iron ore of some importance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magnetite.</span> One of the three important oxides
of iron containing no water, and richer in iron than
hematite. (See <a href="#Fig_75">Figure 75e</a>.) Commonly crystallizes
in isometric octahedral forms alone or combined
with twelve-faced forms. Hardness, 6;
specific gravity, 5. Color, black with metallic
luster. Leaves black streaks on rough porcelain.
Characteristically highly magnetic. Wide-spread
as crystals in nearly all kinds of igneous
rocks, and as large segregation masses in certain
igneous rocks. Also very common in metamorphic
rocks, in many cases forming lenses and beds as ore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">» 334 «</a></span>
deposits. Occurs in some strata and sands. It is an
important ore of iron.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malachite.</span> A light-green hydrous carbonate of
copper. In almost every way, except difference in
color and slight difference in composition, it is very
much like azurite (see <a href="#Azurite">above</a>).</p>

<p><a id="Mica"></a><span class="smcap">Mica Group.</span> The micas rank high in abundance
among the most common minerals of the earth. All
of the several species are silicates of aluminum combined
with other chemical elements according to the
species. All crystallize in monoclinic six-sided
prisms whose angles are nearly 120 degrees. These
prisms closely approach true hexagonal forms. All
are characterized by one exceedingly good cleavage
at right angles to the prismatic faces, yielding very
thin elastic cleavage sheets. Hardness, 2 to 2.5;
specific gravity, 2.7 to 3. The various species or
varieties are not always sharply separated from each
other. Most common are: <i>muscovite</i>, or so-called
<i>isinglass</i>, a potash mica which is colorless and
transparent in thin sheets when pure; <i>biotite</i>, an
iron-magnesia mica, black to dark green; and <i>phlogopite</i>,
a brown magnesia mica.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olivine.</span> Often called <i>chrysolite</i>. A silicate of
iron and magnesia. Orthorhombic crystals, usually
in stout prismatic form. Color, usually yellowish
green. Hardness, nearly 7; specific gravity, 3.3.
Transparent to translucent. No real cleavage. Its
hardness, color, and crystal form generally characterize
it. It is a fairly common mineral found
mainly as crystalline grains in certain dark-colored
igneous rocks. A clear green variety, called <i>peridot</i>,
is used as a gem stone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Opal.</span> An oxide of silicon, like quartz in composition
except that it is combined with a varying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">» 335 «</a></span>
amount of water. It never crystallizes, probably
because of its rather indefinite composition. Hardness
5.5 to 6.5 (softer than quartz); specific gravity,
about 2. Varieties variously colored. <i>Common opal</i>,
usually translucent with greasy luster. <i>Precious
opal</i>, translucent with beautiful play of colors, used
as a gem. <i>Fire opal</i>, with bright red to orange internal
reflections. <i>Hyalite</i>, colorless and transparent in
small rounded masses. <i>Wood opal</i>, wood petrified
by opal. <i>Geyserite</i>, a white, porous, stringy variety
deposited by certain hot springs like the Yellowstone
geysers. <i>Tripolite</i>, fine-grained, chalklike in
appearance, consisting of tiny siliceous shells of
very simple plants called diatoms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Platinum.</span> This mineral occurs as an impure
native metal, usually alloyed with certain other
metals. Native platinum, hardness, 4.5 (exceptionally
high for a metal); specific gravity as usually alloyed,
14 to 19. Pure platinum, specific gravity, over
21, or one of the very heaviest known substances.
Color, light steel-gray, with metallic luster. Very
malleable and ductile. A rare metal found commercially
mostly in gravel or &ldquo;placer&rdquo; deposits mostly
in the Ural Mountains, also as grains in certain dark
igneous rocks. Used for many scientific instruments,
in the electrical industry, as jewelry, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pyrite.</span> Commonly called &ldquo;iron pyrites.&rdquo; Sometimes
called &ldquo;fool&rsquo;s gold.&rdquo; (See <a href="#Fig_74">Figure 74m</a>.) A
sulphide of iron which commonly crystallizes in
the isometric system mostly as cubes, twelve-faced
pyritohedrons, octahedrons, or combinations
of these. Color, light brass-yellow, with metallic
luster. Cleavage, practically absent. Hardness,
greater than that of steel (over 6 in the
scale); specific gravity, about 5. Leaves greenish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">» 336 «</a></span>
black streak when rubbed on rough porcelain. Differs
from chalcopyrite by paler color and much
greater hardness. It is a common and very widely
disseminated mineral in rocks of all kinds and ages,
but especially in metamorphic rocks as veins, and
banded or lenslike deposits. Most igneous rocks
contain small scattering grains of pyrite. Many deposits
of commercial value are known. Great quantities
are burned for the manufacture of sulphuric
acid (&ldquo;oil of vitriol&rdquo;) which is one of the most
important of all chemicals.</p>

<p><a id="Pyroxene"></a><span class="smcap">Pyroxene Group.</span> Along with quartz and feldspars,
the pyroxenes rank among the most common
of all minerals. (See <a href="#Fig_74">Figure 74k</a>.) Composition,
very similar to amphibole (see <a href="#Amphibole">above</a>). Pyroxenes
crystallizing in the monoclinic system are
the most important. These crystals are prismatic
in habit, with prism faces making angles
of nearly 45 or 90 degrees instead of about 124
degrees as in the monoclinic amphiboles which
the monoclinic pyroxenes greatly resemble. Two
fairly good prismatic cleavages cross at an angle
of nearly 90 degrees, instead of at about 124
degrees as in the monoclinic amphiboles. Hardness,
5 to 6; specific gravity, 3.2 to 3.6. Color, variable
according to species. The most common variety
of pyroxene is <i>augite</i>, a dark-green to black silicate
of aluminum, iron, lime, and magnesia. Certain
pyroxenes also crystallize in the orthorhombic system.
Pyroxene is most abundantly represented as
crystals in many kinds of igneous and metamorphic
rocks. It is practically useless except as one kind
of <i>jade</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quartz.</span> Next to the feldspars, quartz is probably
the most common of all minerals, especially at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">» 337 «</a></span>
and near the earth&rsquo;s surface. (See <a href="#Fig_74">Figures 74e,
74f, and 74g</a>.) Composition, oxide of silicon. Often
crystallizes in the trigonal system almost always
as six-sided prisms capped by six-sided pyramids,
which are really combined three-sided forms,
often with alternate corners modified by small
faces. These small modifying faces, etching
figures, and microscopic tests show that quartz
is really trigonal in spite of the common occurrence
of simple six-sided outward forms. The pyramidal
faces make different angles than those of either
apatite or beryl, both of which are somewhat like
quartz in crystal form. Hardness, 7 (distinctly
high, cannot be scratched by the knife); specific
gravity, 2.6 (about average for all minerals). Cleavage,
practically absent, and breaks like glass. Colorless
when pure, but varieties exhibit many colors. A
few only of the many varieties will be briefly described.
Among the distinctly crystalline varieties
are: <i>rock crystal</i>, pure colorless; <i>amethyst</i>, purple;
<i>rose quartz</i>, pink; <i>milky quartz</i>, white; and <i>smoky
quartz</i>, dark&mdash;due to tiny inclusions of carbon.
Among the fine-grained, compact more or less indistinctly
crystalline or noncrystalline varieties, usually
translucent with a waxy luster, are: <i>chalcedony</i>,
bluish gray, waxy looking, usually in small rounded
masses; <i>carnelian</i>, red; <i>prase</i>, green; <i>agate</i>, with
parallel bands, usually variously colored; <i>flint</i> and
<i>jasper</i>, opaque to translucent, dark to red.</p>

<p>Quartz is exceedingly abundant in all the great
groups of rocks. It constitutes the main bulk of
sandstones, is common in shales, and occurs in certain
other strata. In many igneous rocks, like
granite, it is a very prominent constituent. Most of
the metamorphic rocks contain its crystalline forms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">» 338 «</a></span>
in greater or less amounts. Quartz is the most common
of all vein minerals, in many cases associated
with valuable ores. Various varieties are widely
used for ornamental purposes. Used in making
sandpaper, glass, porcelain, mortar, concrete, and
in certain ore-smelting processes. Sandstone is
widely used as a building stone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Serpentine.</span> A hydrous silicate of magnesia
never in distinct crystals as such, but shown to be
monoclinic under the microscope. Hardness variable,
2.5 to 5; specific gravity, about 2.6. Mostly of
variegated green or yellowish green color with waxy
luster, except a fibrous variety (<i>asbestos</i>) which is
light green to white. The fibrous variety of serpentine
is the principal source of asbestos, an amphibole
asbestos being less common. Ordinary serpentine
(sometimes miscalled &ldquo;green marble&rdquo;) is
widely used as a building and decorative stone.
Serpentine is common and widespread, especially in
igneous and metamorphic rocks, but never as a
really original mineral. It always results from
alteration of certain other magnesia-bearing silicate
minerals, such as pyroxene, amphibole, olivine, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silver.</span> Native silver is not a very rare mineral
and it is mined in certain parts of the world, but most
of the metal is obtained from certain silver-bearing
minerals, especially sulphides and a chloride. Silver
crystallizes rather rarely in the isometric system.
More commonly it occurs as irregular masses, plates,
and wirelike forms. Characterized by its color,
metallic luster, softness (less than 3 in the
scale), and exceptional weight (specific gravity,
10.5). Usually occurs in vein deposits, commonly
associated with other metals or metal-bearing minerals,
especially copper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">» 339 «</a></span></p>

<p><a id="Sphalerite"></a><span class="smcap">Sphalerite.</span> A sulphide of zinc commonly in
crystalline form belonging in the isometric system,
especially in tetrahedral combination forms (see
<a href="#Fig_75">Figure 75b</a>). Color, usually brown, yellow or nearly
black with resinous luster. Hardness, nearly 4;
specific gravity, 4. Several good cleavages, yielding
fragments whose faces meet at 90 and 120 degrees.
Sphalerite is a fairly common and widespread mineral,
occurring nearly always in veins in most kinds
of rocks. It is very often associated with other ores,
particularly the great ore of lead (galena). Sphalerite
is by far the greatest ore of zinc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphur.</span> Native sulphur. Crystallization, orthorhombic,
usually in combination pyramidal
forms. (See <a href="#Fig_75">Figure 75h</a>.) Characterized by yellow
color, resinous luster, softness (about 2 in the scale),
low specific gravity (about 2), and very poor cleavages.
It has most commonly resulted from alteration
of certain sulphur-bearing minerals, especially
gypsum, the decomposition of which has yielded vast
deposits. Some also of volcanic origin. Great
quantities are used in making sulphuric acid,
matches, gunpowder, fireworks, and for vulcanizing
and bleaching rubber goods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Talc.</span> Often called <i>steatite</i>. Monoclinic crystals
rare. One perfect cleavage, yielding very thin, flexible
leaves. Very soft (hardness, 1). Feels greasy,
and looks waxy to pearly. Color, white, gray, to
light green. Specific gravity, 2.8. Composition, a
hydrous silicate of magnesia, much like that of serpentine.
Talc is always of secondary origin, generally
derived by chemical alteration of various
common minerals rich in silicate of magnesia. <i>Soapstone</i>
is a common variety resulting from alteration
of whole rock masses. Soapstone has many practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">» 340 «</a></span>
uses as for washtubs, table tops, electrical
switchboards, hearthstones, stove and furnace linings,
blackboards, gas tips, etc. Talc proper is used
as a lubricant, to weight paper, in soap, as dustless
crayon, talcum powder, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topaz.</span> A silicate of aluminum and fluorine. Orthorhombic
crystals common, usually prisms capped
at one end by pyramided faces and abruptly terminated
at the other. Colorless when pure, but often
variously colored due to impurities. Very exceptionally
hard (8 in the scale); specific gravity, 3.5. One
good cleavage across the prism zone; usually found
as crystals in, and in cavities in, igneous rocks. Appears
always to have formed from highly heated
vapors or liquids given off by cooling molten rock
masses. Topaz is one of the more highly prized of
the gem stones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourmaline.</span> Composition, very complex, but
chiefly a silicate of boron and several metals and
semimetals. Commonly as crystals in the trigonal
system in both long and short prismatic forms, as
shown by <a href="#Fig_75">Figure 75m</a>, with opposite ends not unlike.
Extra hard (7 in the scale); specific gravity, about
3. Color, widely various, but brown and black are
most common. Practically no cleavage. Tourmaline
probably always originated as a high temperature
mineral, especially as crystals in granites and related
rocks and in certain metamorphic rocks which
have been subjected to high temperature and pressure.
Certain transparent colored varieties of tourmaline
rank high among the semiprecious stones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turquoise.</span> A hydrous phosphate of aluminum.
Massive noncrystalline, blue to green, waxy luster,
mostly opaque, hardness of 6, and specific gravity
of about 2.7. Turquoise is a high temperature mineral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">» 341 «</a></span>
found in veins and cavities in certain igneous
rocks. It is a rare mineral used as a gem stone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zircon.</span> A silicate of zirconium usually crystallized
in the tetragonal system as simple four-sided
prisms capped by four-sided pyramids. (See
<a href="#Fig_75">Figure 75l</a>.) Very poor cleavages. Color usually
brown. Hardness, 7.5 (extra high); specific
gravity, nearly 4.7. Brilliant luster. Zircon is
very commonly present as scattering crystals of
varying size in most igneous rocks. Also common
as crystals in various metamorphosed stratified
rocks, and less common in some sand and
gravel deposits. Certain transparent varieties, especially
the brown and pink ones called <i>hyacinth</i>,
are used as gem stones. Zircon is also the source
of oxide of zirconium used in making mantles for
certain incandescent lights.</p>

<p class="caption3">ECONOMIC GEOLOGY</p>

<div class="dropcap">I</div>
<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">I</span>N this chapter it is our purpose to briefly consider
geology in its direct relations to the arts and industries.
When we realize that the value of strictly
geologic products taken from the earth each year
in the United States alone amounts to billions of
dollars, we can better appreciate the practical application
of geological science. Such products include
coal, petroleum, natural gas, many valuable
metal-bearing minerals, and many nonmetalliferous
minerals and rocks. In most cases these valuable
products of nature have been slowly accumulated or
concentrated at many times and under widely varying
conditions throughout the millions of years of
known geological time. To trace the extent of, and
most advantageously remove, such deposits for the
use of man is always invariably impossible unless
geological knowledge is brought to bear. In many
cases the problems involved are intricate, and only
the trained geologist is able to at all successfully
cope with them. In such cases it is necessary not
only to have a thorough knowledge of minerals and
rocks as such, but also of their origin and structure.
Much of the practical application of geology is carried
out by the mining engineer who should have,
above all, a thorough knowledge of the great principles
of geology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">» 343 «</a></span></p>

<p>Our plan of discussion is to consider, first, coal,
petroleum, and natural gas; then the most important
metalliferous deposits of ores; and finally nonmetalliferous
minerals and rocks of exceptional
commercial importance. Underground waters have
already been discussed from the practical standpoint
in the chapter on &ldquo;Waters Within the Earth.&rdquo;
Certain minerals have already been sufficiently considered
from the economic standpoint in the chapter
on &ldquo;Mineralogy.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="caption3">COAL, PETROLEUM, AND NATURAL GAS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coal.</span> Most valuable of all geological products is
coal. Although it is not, strictly speaking, a mineral,
both because of its organic origin and lack of definite
chemical composition, coal is generally classed
among our mineral resources. Some idea of the
national importance of coal in the United States may
be gained when we realize that the energy derived
from a single year&rsquo;s output is equivalent to that of
hundreds of millions of men working full time
through the year. The uses of coal are too well
known to need mention here.</p>

<p>Coal is, beyond question, of organic (plant)
origin as shown by its very composition; perfect
gradations between plant deposits like peat and true
coal; and the presence of microscopic plant remains
and spores in the coal. An excellent summary of
just what happens during the transition of ordinary
vegetable matter into coal has been given by D.
White as follows: "All coal was laid down in beds
analogous to the peat beds of to-day. All kinds of
plants, especially such species as were adapted to the
particular region where the deposit was located, in
whole or in part went into the deposit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">» 344 «</a></span></p>

<p>"Plants are composed chiefly of cellulose and
proteins. The former, comprising by far the
larger bulk, constitute the framework, whereas
the latter are concerned in the vital functions.
With these are associated many other substances,
among which are chiefly starch, sugars, and fats
and oils, constituting reserve foodstuffs; waxes,
resin waxes, resins, and higher fats, performing
mainly protective functions.... These
components differ widely in their resistance to
various agencies. Those substances involved in
the life function and the support of the plant are
relatively very stable under the conditions imposed
upon them.</p>

<p>"At the death of the plants, governed by conditions
imposed in the bog, a partial decomposition,
maceration, elimination, and chemical reduction
begins, brought about by various agencies, chiefly
organic, mainly fungi at first and bacteria
later. The most labile are removed first, the
more resistant next, and so on, as the conditions
require, leaving the most resistant behind in a
residue called peat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The process of decomposition, elimination, and
chemical reduction begun in peat, chiefly by biochemical
means, is taken up and continued by
dynamochemical means into and through the various
successive later stages, and results in the
various grades of coal, as lignite, sub-bituminous,
and cannel coal, and anthracite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The principal chemical elements involved in the
changes which take place are carbon, oxygen, and
hydrogen, as shown by the following analyses of
about average samples of each member of the so-called
&ldquo;coal series.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this table it is seen that the oxygen relatively
diminishes while the carbon relatively increases,
though, of course, all three elements actually
decrease during the chemical change from
cellulose to coal. These three elements disappear
mainly in the form of gases, such as water vapor,
marsh gas, and carbonic acid gas. The final or
graphite stage is almost reached by the graphitic
anthracite of Rhode Island, which is so nearly pure
carbon as to be really useless as coal.</p>

<p>The conditions under which successive layers of
vegetable matter (later turned into coal) become
embedded in the earth&rsquo;s crust have been outlined
in the chapter on the &ldquo;Evolution of Plants.&rdquo; The
most perfect conditions for prolific plant growth,
and accumulation as great beds in the earth&rsquo;s crust,
were during the Pennsylvanian period of the late
Paleozoic era in many parts of the world, but especially
in the United States, China, Great Britain,
and Germany. Most of the world&rsquo;s great supply of
coal comes from rocks of Pennsylvanian Age, while
next in importance are Cretaceous rocks, and some
comes from strata of other ages later than the Pennsylvanian,
even as late as the Tertiary.</p>

<p>The United States not only has the greatest
known coal fields, but it also produces far more coal
than any other country. In 1918 the production
was 678,000,000 tons, the greatest in our history,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">» 346 «</a></span>
or enough, if loaded into cars of forty tons capacity,
to fill a train which would reach around the earth at
the equator about six times! Equally amazing is
the fact that this coal was nearly all consumed by
this one nation! In 1919 the production fell to 544,000,000
tons. Is there real danger that our supply
of coal will soon run out? Hardly so when we consider,
first, the fact that probably not more than
1 per cent of the readily available coal has thus far
been removed, and, second, the high probability that
rate of increase in coal production for the last
twenty years will not continue. In fact, during the
last two or three years the production has fallen
off considerably. But even so, coal, which is our
greatest natural resource, and which can never be
replaced, should be scientifically conserved. In the
case of the very restricted anthracite coal fields
what might be called a crisis has already been
reached, because a very considerable part of the
available supply has been taken out.</p>

<p>Something like 350,000 square miles of the United
States are underlain with one or more beds of workable
coal (not including lignite)&mdash;in some areas five
to twenty or more beds one above the other. There
are also about 150,000 square miles of country
underlain with the more or less imperfect coal
called lignite. It has been estimated that there are
more than a trillion tons of easily accessible coal,
and another trillion tons accessible with some difficulty
in the principal coal fields of the United
States.</p>

<p>The greatest production of coal by far is from
the Appalachian Mountain and Allegheny Plateau
districts, from the western half of Pennsylvania to
Alabama, where all the coal is bituminous of Pennsylvanian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">» 347 «</a></span>
Age. Here as well as elsewhere the coal
beds are interstratified with various kinds of sedimentary
rocks, most commonly with shales and
sandstones. In the Appalachian field the strata including
coal beds are more or less folded toward
the east, while they are nearly horizontal toward the
west. The famous Pittsburgh coal bed is probably
the most extensive important single coal bed known.
It covers an area of over 12,000 square miles and is
workable, with a thickness of five to fifteen feet,
over an area of 6,000 square miles of parts of western
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.</p>

Survey.)</div>
</div>

<p>The greatest production of anthracite coal by far
is from central-eastern Pennsylvania, where strata
of Pennsylvania Age, including a number of anthracite
beds, are mostly highly folded. Most
remarkable of all in this district is the so-called
&ldquo;mammoth bed&rdquo; of anthracite, nearly everywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">» 348 «</a></span>
present, with a thickness up to as much as fifty or
sixty feet. Less than 500 square miles are there
underlain by workable anthracite coal.</p>

<p>Next to the greatest production of coal in the
United States is from the two large areas in the
middle of the Mississippi Valley. It is all bituminous
coal, associated with nearly horizontal strata
of Pennsylvanian Age.</p>

<p>The scattering areas through the Rocky Mountains
yield all types of coal&mdash;anthracite, bituminous,
and lignite. In some of these areas the coal beds have
been but little disturbed from their original horizontal
position, but usually they are more or less
folded along with the inclosing strata, the crustal
disturbances affecting the coal beds having taken
place late in the Mesozoic era and early in the
Cenozoic era. Practically all of these coals are of
Cretaceous and Tertiary Ages, the best being Cretaceous.
Very little of the Rocky Mountain coal is
anthracite.</p>

<p>On the Pacific Coast coal production is relatively
very small. The coals are there bituminous to lignitic
of Tertiary Age, usually folded in with the
strata.</p>

<p>In Alaska there are widely distributed, relatively
small coal fields, but they have been little developed.
Alaskan coals range in age from Pennsylvanian to
Tertiary, and in kind from anthracite to lignite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petroleum.</span> Crude oil or petroleum is an organic
substance consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons,
that is, it is made up very largely of the
two chemical elements carbon and hydrogen, in
rather complex and variable combinations. It is
practically certain that petroleum has been derived
by a sort of slow process of distillation from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">» 349 «</a></span>
organic matter&mdash;animal
or vegetable or both&mdash;in
stratified rocks within
the earth. Many strata,
as for example carbonaceous
shales, are more
or less charged with
dark-colored decomposing
organic matter. The
chemical composition itself,
the kinds of rocks
with which it is associated,
and certain optical
(microscopic) tests
all point to the organic
origin of petroleum. In
southern California at
least, certain of the oils
have quite certainly been
derived from the very
tiny oily plants called
diatoms which fill many
of the strata.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 807px;">

</div>

<p>During the last twenty
years petroleum has
come to be one of the
most important and useful
natural products.
Among the many substances
artificially derived
from petroleum
are kerosene, gasoline,
naphtha, benzine, vaseline,
and paraffine. The
United States leads in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">» 350 «</a></span>
the production of petroleum, while southern Russia
and Mexico are very important producers. In the
United States the principal areas underlain with
petroleum-bearing strata are the northern Appalachian
field (through western Pennsylvania to central
West Virginia); the Ohio-Indiana field (central
Indiana to northwestern Ohio); the mid-continental
field (southeastern Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma);
the southeastern Texas-Louisiana field; and
the southwestern California field. The total areas
underlain with oil total about 10,000 square miles.
In the Appalachian, Ohio-Indiana, and mid-continental
fields the strata carrying oil range in age from
Ordovician to Pennsylvanian, and they are mostly
but little disturbed from their original horizontal
position. The Texas-Louisiana oils come mainly
from Cretaceous and Tertiary strata which gently
downtilt under the Coastal Plain toward the Gulf.
In California the oil-bearing strata are of Tertiary
Age and generally considerably disturbed and
folded.</p>

<p>Under proper conditions below the earth&rsquo;s surface
the derived oil accumulates in porous or fractured
rocks. There must, of course, be a source
from which the petroleum is derived or distilled; a
porous or fractured rock formation to take it up;
a cap rock or impervious layer to hold it in; and a
proper geologic structure to favor accumulation.
The most common porous (containing) rock is sandstone,
and the most common cap rock is shale. Oil
is rarely found without gas, and saline water is
likewise often present. If the containing strata are
horizontal, the oil and gas are usually irregularly
scattered, but if tilted or folded, and the beds
porous throughout, they appear to collect at the
highest point possible. It was the result of observations
along this line that led I. C. White to develop
what is known as the &ldquo;anticlinal theory.&rdquo;
According to this theory, in folded areas the gas
collects at the summit of the fold (anticline), with
the oil immediately below, on either side, followed
by the water. It is, of course, necessary that the
oil-bearing stratum shall be capped by a practically
impervious one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the rocks are dry, then the chief points of accumulation
of the oil will be at or near the bottom
of the syncline (downfold), or lowest portion of the
porous bed. If the rocks are partially saturated
with water, then the oil accumulates at the upper
level of saturation. In a tilted bed, which is locally
porous, and not so throughout, the oil, gas, and
water may arrange themselves according to their
gravity in this porous part.&rdquo; (Ries.)</p>

<p>Although the term &ldquo;oil pool&rdquo; is commonly used,
there is really no actual pool or underground lake of
oil, but rather porous rock saturated with oil. It
has been estimated that in an oil field of average
productiveness a cubic foot of the porous rock contains
from six to twelve pints of oil. The life of a
well drilled into an &ldquo;oil pool&rdquo; varies from a few
months to twenty or thirty years, or sometimes even
more, but a heavy producer (especially a &ldquo;gusher&rdquo;)
almost invariably falls off very notably in production
in a few months, or at most a few years. The
typical Pennsylvanian oil well is said to last about
seven years. The fact that the United States is
still able to increase oil output is because new fields
are found and developed, the most recent being in
the interior and northern parts of Texas. It is
practically certain, however, that the climax of oil
production in the United States will be reached before
many years&mdash;long before that of bituminous
coal.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that oil, as well as natural
gas, is usually under more or less pressure within
the earth. The pressure is so great in some cases
that where, in the course of drilling, oil or gas
accumulated under proper conditions, as for example
those shown by <a href="#Fig_79">Figure 79</a>, are encountered the
pressure may be hundreds of pounds per square
inch, or enough to blow to pieces much of the drilling
outfit. It is under such conditions that great
&ldquo;gushers&rdquo; are struck. A wonderful case in point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">» 354 «</a></span>
was the famous Lakeview gusher, struck in California
in 1910. &ldquo;Within a few days the well was
far beyond control. It continued to flow (for a
time shooting high into the air) for eighteen
months, finally stopping after it had produced
over 8,000,000 barrels of oil, about 6,000,000 of
which had been saved. The daily production
of the well varied greatly, reaching a maximum
of 65,000 barrels.&rdquo; (Pack.) One very common
cause of oil pressure is the expansive force of
the associated imprisoned gas which steadily increases
as the gas is generated. Another cause
which is seemingly applicable in many cases is
hydrostatic pressure, where under certain structural
conditions the pressure of water in a long-tilted
layer is exerted against oil accumulated
toward the top of an anticline (or upbend) in
the strata.</p>

<p>The world&rsquo;s output of petroleum for 1917 was
nearly 559,000,000 barrels, of which the United
States produced nearly 338,000,000 barrels, Mexico
87,000,000 barrels, and Russia 34,000,000 barrels of
42 gallons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Natural Gas.</span> The most perfect fuel with which
nature has provided us is natural gas. Not only
is it easily transported even long distances through
pipes, but also as a fuel it is easily regulated, leaves
no refuse, and is less damaging to boilers than
coal. It is a colorless, odorless, free-burning gas,
consisting very largely of the simple hydrocarbon
called marsh gas or fire damp. Petroleum nearly
always has more or less natural gas associated with
it, but in some cases considerable quantities of gas
may exist alone. Natural gas, like petroleum, is of
organic origin&mdash;a product of slow natural distillation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">» 355 «</a></span>
of vegetable or animal matter, or both, within
the earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>

<p>One of the most common modes of occurrence of
gas is at the top of an anticline (upfold) in porous
rock (like sandstone) between impervious layers
(like shale). <a href="#Fig_79">Figure 79</a> well illustrates the principle,
the gas lying above the oil, and the oil above
the water; that is, the three substances are arranged
according to specific gravity. Gas may also exist in
considerable quantities in irregular bodies of porous
or fractured rocks. Natural gas is nearly always
under pressure within the earth, hundreds of pounds
per square inch being common, while more exceptionally,
as in certain West Virginia wells, pressures
of over 1,000 pounds have been registered.</p>

<p>The United States is by far the greatest world
producer of natural gas, the output for 1918 having
been 720,000,000,000 cubic feet. West Virginia
easily headed the list, with Oklahoma and Pennsylvania
next in order. Areas underlain with natural
gas are, in the main, the same as for petroleum,
and they total more than 10,000 square miles.
During the last forty years the waste of natural gas
in the United States has been appalling. In many
cases wells in quest of oil have encountered gas and
often such abandoned wells have been allowed to
play millions of cubic feet of gas daily into the air
for years. A striking example was the Murraysville
well of western Pennsylvania, which shot
20,000,000 cubic feet of gas per day into the air
for six years!</p>


<p class="caption3">METAL-BEARING (ORE) DEPOSITS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iron.</span> Without question the most useful of all
metals is iron. As such it is rare in nature, but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">» 356 «</a></span>
chemical combination with other substances it is
extremely widespread and very common. Iron
makes up about 5 per cent of the weight of the
earth&rsquo;s crust, but in the form of ore (i.e., a metal-bearing
mineral or rock of sufficient value to be
mined) it is notably restricted in occurrence. The
three great ores of iron are the minerals hematite,
magnetite, and limonite, whose composition and
characteristic properties the reader will find stated
in the preceding chapter on &ldquo;Mineralogy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the worst impurities in iron ore is phosphorus,
which makes iron &ldquo;cold short,&rdquo; i.e., brittle
when cold. Ore for the manufacture of Bessemer
steel must contain very little phosphorus
(less than 1/1000 of the metallic iron content of
the ore). Sulphur as an impurity in the ore tends
to make the iron &ldquo;hot short.&rdquo; Silica (quartz) is
bad because it necessitates the use of more lime for
flux in the furnace.</p>

<p>Iron ores occur in rocks of most of the great
geologic ages, but in the United States principally
in the pre-Paleozoic and Paleozoic. The United
States is by far the greatest producer of iron ore in
the world, the output for 1917 having been about
75,288,000 tons, the greatest in the history of this or
any other country. This one year&rsquo;s output loaded
into cars of 40 tons capacity would have made a
train about 15,000 miles long! All but about 5,000,000
tons of this tremendous production was hematite
ore. In 1919 the output of iron ore dropped to about
60,000,000 tons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">» 357 «</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 458px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span>&mdash;Drawing showing details of part of an ore-bearing vein at
Pinos Altos, New Mexico. The chalcopyrite and sphalerite are the ores.
Somewhat reduced in size. (After Paige, U. S. Geological Survey.)</div>
</div>


<p>We shall now very briefly consider several of
the greatest iron-mining districts of the United
States, giving some idea of the modes of occurrence
and origin of the ores. Greatest of all is the Lake
Superior region, not far west and south of the lake
in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Considerably
more than one-half the iron ore mined in the
United States comes from the single State of Minnesota,
and about one-fourth of it from Michigan.
Most of the Minnesota ore by far is obtained from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">» 358 «</a></span>
the so-called &ldquo;Mesaba Range,&rdquo; which in 1917 produced
41,000,000 tons of hematite ore. The ore
deposits are there of irregular shape, lying at or
near the surface (usually covered only by glacial
deposits). None of them extend downward more
than a few hundred feet. The soft, high-grade ore
is removed by steam shovels in great open pits. In
the several districts of northern Michigan and Wisconsin
the ores (nearly all hematite) are associated
with more or less highly folded rocks at considerable
depths. The Lake Superior iron ores all
occur in rocks of Archeozoic and Proterozoic Ages.
According to the best explanation of their origin the
iron of the ores was once part of a sedimentary
series of rocks in the form of iron carbonate and
silicate, interstratified with layers of a flintlike rock
associated with slate, quartzite, etc. After these
rocks were raised into land and subjected to
weathering the old iron compounds were altered
to oxides, mainly hematite, and somewhat concentrated.
Further concentration of the ore was
caused by dissolving out the flintlike layers of
the old rocks.</p>

<p>The Birmingham, Ala., region is the second most
important iron ore producer in the United States,
with an output of nearly 6,000,000 tons in 1918. The
ore is hematite, forming part of the famous Clinton
iron ore deposits of Silurian Age. This deposit,
named from Clinton, N. Y., extends through
central New York and in more or less interrupted
parallel bands through the Appalachian Mountains
to near Birmingham where the richest deposits
occur. This ore appears to be an original bed (or
locally several beds) of fairly rich iron ore deposited
on the shallow Silurian sea bottom and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">» 359 «</a></span>
covered by other strata. At the time of the Appalachian
Mountain revolution the iron ore was more
or less highly folded in with other strata throughout
the Appalachians. A remarkable fact regarding
the Birmingham district is that in the near
vicinity of the ore there are both coal for fuel and
limestone flux for smelting the ores.</p>

<p>The next most important mining region of the
United States is the Adirondack Mountain region of
northern New York, where about 1,000,000 tons of
ore are obtained yearly. Magnetite is the ore, and
it occurs in more or less irregular lenses and bands
in granite and closely associated rocks of pre-Paleozoic
Age. One view regarding the origin of this
ore is that it segregated during the process of cooling
of the molten granite, and another view (recently
advocated by the author) is that it was derived
from an older iron-rich igneous formation
by either the molten granite or very hot solutions
from it and concentrated into the ores. About
2,500,000 tons of magnetite were mined in the
United States in 1916, nearly one-half of it in the
Adirondacks.</p>

<p>The third important iron ore is limonite, nearly
2,000,000 tons of which were produced in the
United States in 1916. Most of it came from the
Appalachian Mountains. All of this limonite is of
secondary origin; that is, it has been derived from
certain early Paleozoic iron-bearing limestones
either by weathering or solution, and concentrated
into ore deposits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Copper.</span> This is one of the most useful of all
metals. Several of its very important uses are as a
conductor of electricity in the form of wire; in making
alloys such as brass and bronze; in copperplate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">» 360 «</a></span>
engraving; and in roofing and plumbing. Various
minerals containing copper are found in many parts
of the world, but only about six of them are really
important as ores. These are native copper, chalcopyrite,
chalcocite, azurite, malachite, and cuprite,
most of which are described in the chapter on
&ldquo;Mineralogy.&rdquo; The number of places where they
may be profitably mined as ore is distinctly limited.
Fifteen or twenty countries produce more or less
copper, but the United States is by far the greatest
producer, with an output of nearly 2,000,000,000
pounds of copper in 1916, the output having fallen
off some in 1918. This was two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s
output and ten times as much as the nearest competitor.
The other leading countries are Japan,
Chile, Mexico, Spain, and Canada. In 1918 the four
leading States in order were Arizona, Montana,
Michigan, and Utah, with production ranging from
nearly 765,000,000 pounds to about 230,000,000
pounds.</p>

<p>In Arizona several great copper-mining districts
lie in the southeastern one-fourth of the State. Almost
invariably the ores are directly associated
with limestone and an igneous rock (granite), both
of late Paleozoic Age. The ores are almost always
near the border between the two rocks, mostly as
great irregular deposits within the limestone, and
less commonly as veins within the granite. The
original ores were carried in solution and deposited
by hot liquids (or vapors) from the cooling granite.
At lower levels the ores are mainly sulphides of
copper (e.g., chalcopyrite and chalcocite), while at
higher levels they are mostly carbonates (malachite
and azurite) and oxides (e.g. cuprite). The
difference is due to the fact that the ores nearer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">» 361 «</a></span>
the surface have been subjected to weathering and
altered from their original condition.</p>

<p>The region around Butte, Mont., is next to the
greatest copper producer. Nearly all the ores are
sulphides of copper (mainly chalcocite) which occur
with quartz in a great system of nearly parallel
veins in granite of Tertiary Age. &ldquo;It is supposed
that in the copper veins the hot ore-bearing solutions
ascended the fractures in the granite, replacing
the rock by ore, and resulting in an intense
alteration of the walls.&rdquo; (Ries.)</p>

<p>Third in rank among the copper-producing States
is Michigan, the mines being located on Keweenaw
Peninsula, which extends into Lake Superior. For
fully fifty years this district has been one of the
most famous and important copper producers in the
world. A unique feature is that the ore is native
copper, associated with some native silver. The
rocks containing the ore are steeply tilted lava
sheets and conglomerate (cemented gravel) strata
of Proterozoic Age. Openings in porous lava and
spaces between the conglomerate pebbles have been
filled by metallic copper, which was carried off in
hot solutions from the cooling lavas. Certain of
the mining shafts have been sunk more than 5,000
feet below the surface, these being next to the
deepest in the world.</p>

<p>Utah ranks fourth among the copper producers,
the greatest mining district being at Bingham
Canyon, southwest of Salt Lake City. The rocks
are late Paleozoic strata, pierced by a large body of
igneous rock. Some of the sulphide ores (mainly
chalcopyrite) occur in veins in the igneous rock and
some in large tabular masses in the adjacent limestone.
Hot solutions from lower portions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">» 362 «</a></span>
uncooled igneous rock carried the ore in solution
into the limestone and into cracks in the upper
cooled igneous rock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lead.</span> Lead must surely be counted among the
five or six most useful metals. As in the case of
nearly all the other most important natural resources,
the United States is the world&rsquo;s greatest
producer of lead, the output of metallic lead having
been 552,000 tons in 1916 and somewhat less in
1918. Most of this came from Missouri, Idaho,
Utah, and Colorado. The leading other countries
are in order&mdash;Spain, Germany, Mexico, and Australia.
Nearly all the lead comes from the mineral
galena (a sulphide of lead), which is described in
the chapter on &ldquo;Mineralogy.&rdquo; Among the many
uses of lead are the following: manufacture of certain
high-grade paints from lead compounds; making
alloys such as pewter, type metal, solder, babbit
metal; in plumbing; in glass making; and in the
manufacture of shot.</p>

<p>The greatest lead-mining district is in the vicinity
of Joplin, Mo., where the ore (galena), associated
with much zinc ore, occurs as veins and great
irregular deposits in limestone of early Paleozoic
Age. It is generally agreed that underground
waters dissolved the ores out of the limestone
in which they were disseminated as tiny particles
and deposited them in concentrated form at lower
levels.</p>

<p>In the famous C&oelig;ur d&rsquo;Alene district of northern
Idaho the great output of lead is really obtained
from a lead-silver ore; that is, galena rich in silver.
This ore is in composition a lead-silver sulphide. It
occurs in great fissure veins, mostly following fault
fractures in highly folded strata of Proterozoic Age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">» 363 «</a></span>
Igneous rocks cut through the strata, and it is
believed that hot ore-bearing solutions given off
from the highly heated igneous rocks rose in the
fissures and deposited the ores.</p>

<p>The Park City and Tintic districts of Utah are
great producers of lead. The lead ore (galena)
is usually rich in silver. It occurs mainly in
veins and irregular deposits in limestone of Paleozoic
Age closely associated with certain igneous
rocks.</p>

<p>One of the most famous mining districts in the
world is that around Leadville, Col., where ores of
four metals&mdash;gold, silver, lead, and zinc&mdash;have been
extensively mined. The salient points in the rather
complex geology are the following: Paleozoic strata,
including much limestone, rest upon a foundation
of pre-Paleozoic granite. Sheets of igneous rock are
interbedded with the strata and many dikes of
igneous rocks cut through the whole combination.
After the last igneous activity all the rocks were
somewhat folded and notably faulted in many
places. The ores were dissolved out of the igneous
rock and deposited in large masses mostly in the
limestone and in fissure veins, especially along and
near the fault zones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zinc.</span> Another of the few most useful metals is
zinc. It never occurs in metallic form in nature,
but most of it by far is obtained from the ore mineral
sphalerite (sulphide of zinc) described in the
chapter on &ldquo;Mineralogy.&rdquo; A red oxide of zinc ore,
called zincite, assumes great economic importance
in New Jersey. In 1917 the United States produced
686,000 tons of metallic zinc and was easily
the world&rsquo;s leader. Since 1917 the production has
fallen notably. The four greatest producing States
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">» 364 «</a></span>
are Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, and Colorado.
Germany and Belgium are the greatest foreign
producers.</p>

<p>Most important of all in the United States is the
district around Joplin, Mo., where the ore is closely
associated with lead ore. The mode of occurrence
and origin of these ores are above referred to in
the discussion of lead.</p>

<p>In Montana some of the great east-west fissure
veins in granite are rich in silver ores in the upper
levels, and in zinc ores (mainly sphalerite) at
depths of from some hundreds of feet to nearly
2,000 feet, that is as far down as they have been
mined. They, like the great copper veins of the
same general district, were carried by hot solutions
which rose from the lower still very hot granite
and deposited the ores in fissures of the same cooler
rock higher up.</p>

<p>Two great ore bodies in the general vicinity of
Franklin, N. J., are of unique interest, because they
are mostly the red oxide of zinc called zincite. The
ore deposits occur in white limestone along or close
to its contact with metamorphosed (altered) strata
and granite of early Paleozoic Age. It is not definitely
known how the ore originated, but it was
probably derived in solution from the hot granite
and deposited in the limestone by replacement of
the latter.</p>

<p>In Colorado the principal zinc mines are around
Leadville, where lead ore is nearly always directly
associated with the zinc ore. This district is above
described in the discussion of lead.</p>

<p>Among many uses of zinc are for galvanizing;
for making certain high-grade paints; brass and
white metal; and for roofing and plumbing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">» 365 «</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gold.</span> This precious metal has been used and
highly prized by man for thousands of years. The
discovery of gold in California in 1848 was one of
the most important events in the history of the
mining world. As early as 1852 that State reached
its climax of production with an output of at least
$81,000,000 worth of the metal. The Transvaal
region of South Africa has for two decades been
the world&rsquo;s greatest gold producer. Though long
known, the metal has there been worked only since
1886. In 1915 the peak of gold production in the
world ($468,700,000) was reached and nearly maintained
in 1916, but since that time there has been a
great falling off. In 1916 South Africa produced
gold to the value of about $200,000,000; the United
States over $90,000,000; Australia over $40,000,000;
Russia over $26,000,000; and Canada over
$19,000,000.</p>

<p>In tiny amounts gold is really very widespread.
It occurs in many stream gravels where so-called
&ldquo;color&rdquo; may be obtained by washing gravel, and
it is even dissolved in sea water. Gold-mining localities
are also numerous in many parts of the world,
but relatively few of them only have ever paid. The
total amount of money spent in actual gold-mining
operations; in hopeless but honest operations; and
for stock in fake gold mines has no doubt exceeded
the actual value of gold produced. In many a case
acceptance of a report based upon a very brief
examination of the ground by a competent geologist
would have saved the cost of hopeless expenditure
of money. Some one in nearly every community has
a so-called &ldquo;gold mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the commercially valuable gold occurs in
nature as native gold, either mixed with gravel and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">» 366 «</a></span>
sand (i.e., placer deposits) along existing or ancient
stream beds, or in veins mechanically held in
the mineral pyrite (described in the preceding
chapter) in submicroscopic form, or visibly mixed
with quartz in vein deposits. Another kind of ore
which assumes considerable importance, as in parts
of Colorado, is in the form of telluride of gold always
found in veins. In deep vein deposits it is
quite the rule to find free or native gold mechanically
and visibly mixed with quartz in the upper
levels, while deeper down the gold is mechanically,
but invisibly, held in combination usually in pyrite,
which latter is associated with quartz. This difference
is due to the fact that the lower level ores are
now just as they were formed, while in the upper
levels the ores have been weathered, and the gold
set free and often more or less further concentrated
by solutions. Vein deposits, including also telluride
ores, are found in many kinds of rocks&mdash;igneous,
sedimentary, and metamorphic&mdash;of nearly all ages
generally directly associated with igneous rocks. In
nearly all cases the best evidence indicates that the
vein fillings were formed by hot ore-bearing solutions
from the igneous rock, which solutions deposited
the ore plus quartz in fissures in either the
igneous or adjacent rocks. Among the many localities
where fissure veins of the kind just described
are of great economic importance are the &ldquo;Mother
Lode&rdquo; belt of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California;
Cripple Creek (telluride ore), Georgetown
and the San Juan region of Colorado; Goldfield,
Tonopah, and Comstock Lode of Nevada; and near
Juneau, Alaska.</p>

<p>Placer deposits, that is, free gold mixed with
gravel and sand, also yield much gold. They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">» 367 «</a></span>
most prominently developed in California and
Alaska. These gold-bearing &ldquo;gravels represent the
more resistant products of weathering, such as
quartz and native gold, which have been washed
down from the hills on whose slopes the gold-bearing
quartz veins outcrop, and were too heavy to be
carried any distance, unless the grade was steep.
They have consequently settled down in the stream
channels, the gold, on account of its higher specific
gravity, collecting usually in the lower part of the
gravel (placer) deposit.&rdquo; (Ries.) Such gold occurs
as grains, flakes, or nuggets. When a chunk
of gold-bearing vein quartz, with crevices filled by
thin plates of the metal, is carried downstream pieces
are gradually broken away, and the tough, very malleable
gold bends or welds together into a single
mass called a &ldquo;nugget.&rdquo; Nuggets varying in
weight up to over 2,000 ounces have been found.
Many placer deposits are along existing drainage
channels, while others occur in abandoned and even
buried former channels.</p>

<p>Most of the gold of South Africa comes from Witwatersrand
district where the native metal occurs
in a unique manner in beds or layers of conglomerate
associated with other strata, all the rocks being considerably
folded and somewhat faulted. Some of
the mines are more than a mile deep (vertically),
the deepest in the world. The gold either accumulated
in placer form with gravel which later consolidated
into conglomerate, or it was introduced
into spaces between the pebbles subsequently by ore-bearing
solutions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silver.</span> For many years the United States and
Mexico have been the world&rsquo;s greatest silver producers,
sometimes one and sometimes the other leading,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">» 368 «</a></span>
with Canada third, and Australasia fourth. In
1918 the United States produced nearly 68,000,000
ounces of silver and Mexico over 62,000,000 ounces.
In the United States in 1918 the four leading States
were Montana, Utah, Idaho and Nevada with outputs
ranging from over 10,000,000 to over 15,000,000
ounces each.</p>

<p>In Montana most of the silver is in the native
form, more especially in the upper portions of the
great veins rich in copper and zinc ores near Butte.
These ores and their origin are described above
under the captions &ldquo;Copper&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zinc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two greatest silver districts of Nevada are
Tonopah and Comstock Lode where silver and gold
minerals are associated as ores in Tertiary igneous
rocks, the ores having been deposited in veins by
hot ore-bearing solutions from the igneous rocks.</p>

<p>In Idaho the C&oelig;ur d&rsquo;Alene district produces most
of the silver, the ore there being a silver-bearing
lead ore (galena). The nature and origin of these
deposits are described above under the caption
&ldquo;Lead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Utah the silver is also obtained from silver-bearing
galena especially in the Tintic, Cottonwood
Canyon, and Bingham Canyon districts where the
ores occur mainly as irregular deposits and in fissure
veins in Paleozoic strata (chiefly limestone) directly
associated with igneous rocks, hot ore-bearing solutions
from the igneous rocks having furnished the
ores.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tin.</span> Production of tin in the United States has
never amounted to much, a little mining having been
carried on from time to time in South Carolina,
Black Hills of South Dakota, and southern California.
About one-half of the world&rsquo;s supply of tin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">» 369 «</a></span>
(121,000 long tons 1918) comes from the Malay
Peninsula and two small islands near by. The only
other great producer is Bolivia, though a number of
other countries produce from 1,000 to 9,000 tons each.</p>

<p>The only important ore of tin is the mineral cassiterite
(oxide of tin) described above in the chapter
on &ldquo;Mineralogy.&rdquo; In the Malay region the ore all
occurs in placer deposits and is, therefore, of secondary
origin, the source of the ore not being known.
In Bolivia the tin ore occurs in veins in and close to
granite, the ore having been carried by very hot
vapors or liquids which were derived from the still
highly heated granite.</p>

<p>Tin is used chiefly in the making of tin plate,
bronze, pewter, gun metal, and bell metal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aluminum.</span> The mineral called bauxite (a hydrous
oxide of aluminum) is the great ore from
which aluminum is obtained by an electrical process.
Bauxite is noncrystalline, relatively light in weight,
white to yellowish in color, and in the form of
rounded grains, or earthy or claylike masses. The
United States and France are the only two great
producers of bauxite, most of which is treated for
metallic aluminum. In 1918 the United States produced
more than 100,000 tons of aluminum. In the
United States the principal deposits are in Georgia,
Alabama, and Arkansas. Bauxite is probably always
a secondary mineral formed by decomposition
of igneous rocks rich in certain aluminum silicate
minerals. In some cases, as in the Georgia-Alabama
region, the bauxite appears to have been formed
and concentrated in deposits by hot solutions from
uncooled igneous rocks.</p>

<p>Aluminum is most used in the manufacture of
wire for electric current transmission. It is also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">» 370 «</a></span>
mixed with certain other metals like copper, zinc,
magnesium, and tungsten to form special types of
alloys, some of which possess remarkable tensile
strength up to nearly 50,000 pounds per square inch.
Aluminum is used in powdered form to generate very
high temperatures in certain welding processes.
It is also made into many kinds of utensils and
instruments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mercury.</span> This metal, commonly known as
&ldquo;quicksilver,&rdquo; is of special interest because it is the
only one which exists in liquid form at ordinary
temperatures. The metal occurs in only small quantities
in nature, most of it by far being obtained
from the red mineral cinnabar described in the
chapter on &ldquo;Mineralogy.&rdquo; In order of importance
the greatest quicksilver producing countries in 1916
were Italy, United States, Austria, and Spain. In
the United States, California is by far the leading
State, while Texas and Nevada are the only other
important producers.</p>

<p>In California most of the ore occurs in veins and
irregular deposits in metamorphosed strata of Mesozoic
and Cenozoic ages usually closely associated
with igneous rocks. There, as well as in other parts
of the world, hot vapors from igneous rocks carried
the volatile ore upward and deposited it in fissures.</p>

<p>Among the many uses of mercury are in making
fulminate for explosives; making certain drugs and
chemicals, pigments, electrical and physical apparatus;
silvering mirrors; and in the amalgamation
process of extracting gold and silver.</p>


<p class="caption3">OTHER ECONOMIC PRODUCTS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Building Stones.</span> Some of the principal features
which should be considered in building stones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">» 371 «</a></span>
are power to resist weathering, power to withstand
heat, color, hardness, and density, and crushing
strength. Building stones representing rocks of
nearly all important geologic ages are widely distributed
throughout the world.</p>

<p><i>Granite</i>, including certain other closely related
rocks, is one of the oldest and most useful building
stones. The New England States are the greatest
producers, while the Piedmont Plateau district (east
of the Appalachians) from Philadelphia to Alabama
also contains important granite quarries. In the
Adirondack Mountains, in Wisconsin and Minnesota,
through the Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada
Mountains there are extensive areas of granite
which are relatively little quarried. The granite
occurs only in regions of highly disturbed rocks,
usually in mountains or hills, where great volumes
of the molten rock were forced into the earth&rsquo;s crust,
cooled, and later laid bare by erosion.</p>

<p><i>Marble</i>, according to geological definition, is a
metamorphosed limestone, that is a limestone which
has been crystallized under conditions of heat, pressure,
and moisture within the earth. More loosely
in trade any limestone which takes a polish may be
called marble. The greatest marble-producing districts
of the United States are western New
England (especially Vermont) and the Piedmont
Plateau and Appalachian Mountains in rocks of
Paleozoic age. In northern New York and the
mountains of the west there are relatively few
marble quarries.</p>

<p>Ordinary <i>limestones</i> are widely distributed in
many States where they range in age from early
Paleozoic to Tertiary. Most of the quarries supply
stone for near-by markets. The so-called Bedford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">» 372 «</a></span>
limestone of Indiana has, for many years, been perhaps
the most widely used limestone for building
purposes in the United States.</p>

<p><i>Sandstones</i>, which are stratified rocks consisting
mainly of rounded quartz grains cemented together,
are widely used in building operations. Like limestones,
they are very widespread in formations of all
ages except the very old. There are many sandstone
quarries supplying more or less local markets
throughout the country. Two of the best known and
most widely used sandstones are the so-called brown-stone
of Triassic Age extending interruptedly from
the Connecticut Valley of Massachusetts to North
Carolina, and the Berea, Ohio, sandstone of light
gray color and uniform texture.</p>

<p><i>Slate</i> is mostly a metamorphosed shale, that is a
shale which has been subjected to great pressure
within the earth so that the stratification has been
obliterated and a well defined cleavage has been
developed at right angles to the direction of application
of the pressure. Good slate is fine-grained,
dense, and splits readily into wide thin plates. It
occurs only where mountain making pressure
and metamorphism have been brought to bear
upon the strata. Most of our great slate quarries
are located in early Paleozoic rocks from New England
through the Piedmont Plateau. Some quarries
are also located in Arkansas, Minnesota, and westward
to California.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clay.</span> "Clay, which is one of the most widely
distributed materials and one of the most valuable,
commercially, may be defined as a fine-grained mixture
of the mineral kaolinite with fragments of other
minerals, such as silicates, oxides, and hydrates, and
also often organic compounds, the mass possessing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">» 373 «</a></span>
plasticity when wet and becoming rock-hard when
burned to at least a temperature of redness." (Ries.)</p>

<p>Most clays originate by the weathering of rocks,
particularly igneous and metamorphic rocks rich in
the mineral feldspar. As a result of the decomposition
of the feldspar, much clay is formed, the main
substance of which is kaolin. Both feldspar and
kaolin are described in the preceding chapter. When
the resulting clay rests upon the rock from which it
has been derived it is called residual clay. Much of
the clay is, however, carried away, mainly by
streams, and deposited in lakes or the sea, or on
river flood plains. Some clay deposits are of wind-blown
origin, and still others are formed by the
grinding action of glaciers. Clays are very widespread,
and they are directly associated with rocks
of all geologic ages.</p>

<p>Among the many important uses of clay are the
following: manufacture of common brick, fire brick,
pottery, chinaware, porcelain ware, tiles, terra cotta,
and Portland cement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lime and Cement.</span> Limestone, which is one of
the most common and widespread of all stratified
rocks, forms the basis for the manufacture of the
important substances lime (or &ldquo;quicklime&rdquo;) and
Portland cement. Lime results when pure limestone
(carbonate of lime) is &ldquo;burned&rdquo; or heated to a temperature
high enough to drive off the carbonic acid
gas. The greatest use of lime is for mixing with
water and sand to make mortar. A few of its other
numerous uses are in plastering; whitewashing;
purifying certain steel; in making gas, paper, and
soap; and as a fertilizer.</p>

<p>Certain limestones containing clay of the right
kind and proportion are called natural cement rocks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">» 374 «</a></span>
because, after being &ldquo;burned,&rdquo; they develop the
property of &ldquo;setting,&rdquo; like cement when mixed with
water. The &ldquo;setting&rdquo; of a cement is due to the fact
that certain chemical compounds formed during the
heating crystallize when mixed with water, and the
hard, tiny interlocking crystals of the newly formed
silicate minerals give rigidity to the mass. Of recent
years Portland cement has largely superseded the
natural rock cements. &ldquo;Portland cement is the
product obtained by burning a finely ground artificial
mixture consisting essentially of lime, silica,
alumina, and some iron oxide, these substances
being present in certain definite proportions.&rdquo;
(Ries.) The necessary ingredients are generally
obtained by grinding and burning carefully selected
mixtures of limestone in some form, and clay or
shale. The great and growing uses of cement need
not be detailed here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salt.</span> Most of the common salt (the mineral
&ldquo;halite&rdquo;) of commercial value occurs in nature in
sea or salt lake water; or in beds or strata of rock
salt associated with other strata; or as natural brine
in openings or pores in certain rocks. Considerable
salt is obtained by evaporation of tidewater, as
around San Francisco Bay, and of salt lake water,
as at Great Salt Lake, Utah. It has been estimated
that the Great Salt Lake, whose area is about 2,000
square miles and greatest depth 50 feet, contains
several hundred million tons of common salt. This
salt has been washed out of the rocks of the surrounding
country and gradually accumulated in the
lake because it has no outlet.</p>

<p>Most important of all sources of salt is the rock
salt which occurs in the form of strata within the
earth&rsquo;s crust. Such strata are found in rocks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">» 375 «</a></span>
nearly all ages from the early Paleozoic to the
present. They resulted from the evaporation of
salt lakes or salty more or less cut-off arms of the
sea, after which other strata accumulated on top of
them. Thus in the Silurian system of strata underlying
all of southwestern New York State there
occur almost universally from one to seven beds of
salt. The strata including the salt dip gently southward
so that at Ithaca, New York, seven salt beds
were struck in a well at a depth of about 2,200 feet.
Northward the salt comes nearer and nearer the
surface. One well penetrated a layer of solid salt
325 feet thick. Some of this salt is being mined
much like coal, but most of it is obtained by running
water into deep wells to dissolve the salt, the resulting
brine being pumped out and evaporated.</p>

<p>Under portions of southern Michigan there are
both salt beds and natural brines charging certain
porous rock layers. Both the salt beds (of Silurian
Age) and the brines (of Mississippian Age) supply
great quantities of salt from brines pumped out and
evaporated.</p>

<p>In 1918 the United States produced 51,000,000
barrels (280 lbs. each) of salt. Michigan (17,000,000
barrels) and New York were the leading States,
followed by Kansas, Ohio, West Virginia, and California.
Some of the uses of common salt are given
in the description of halite in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gypsum.</span> The composition and properties of this
common and useful mineral are given in the chapter
on &ldquo;Mineralogy.&rdquo; Rock gypsum is the variety of
great commercial importance. It is widespread,
being quarried in many States, and occurs interstratified
with rocks of many ages where it has originated
by evaporation or partial evaporation of salt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">» 376 «</a></span>
water lakes or more or less cut-off arms of the sea.
Salt beds are often associated with gypsum.</p>

<p>For about ten years the average yearly production
of gypsum in the United States has been approximately
2,500,000 tons, or about ten times that of the
nearest foreign competitor (Canada). New York,
Iowa, Michigan, and Ohio are the chief producers.
In New York the rock gypsum (usually four to ten
feet thick) lies between shale and limestone strata of
Silurian age, and it is quarried from the central to
the western part of the State. In Michigan the rock
gypsum beds, commonly five to twenty feet thick, lie
in Mississippian strata in the southern portion of the
State. A great bed of exceptionally pure rock gypsum
underlies about twenty-five square miles of
Webster County, Iowa, in rocks of late Paleozoic Age.
The Kansas gypsum deposits extend across the central
part of the State in rocks of Permian Age.</p>

<p>Rock gypsum is mainly used in making &ldquo;plaster of
Paris,&rdquo; as a retarder in cement, and as a fertilizer
(so-called &ldquo;land plaster&rdquo;).</p>

to permit tidewater to enter the lower ends of its valleys to
form estuaries, a good example being the lower Hudson
Valley.</p>

<p><i>Era.</i>&mdash;A name applied to one of the broadest subdivisions
of geologic time (e.g. Paleozoic era).</p>

<p><i>Erosion.</i>&mdash;The wearing away and transportation of materials
at and near the earth&rsquo;s surface by weathering and
solution, and the mechanical action of running water, waves,
moving ice, or winds which use rock fragments as tools or
abrasives.</p>

<p><i>Exfoliation.</i>&mdash;The splitting off of sheets of rock of various
sizes and shapes due to changes of temperature. It is a
process of weathering.</p>

<p><i>Fault.</i>&mdash;A fracture in the earth&rsquo;s crust accompanied by
movement of the rock on one side of the break past that on
the other. If the fracture is inclined and the rock on one side
appears to have slid down the slope of the fracture the fault
is termed a normal fault. If, on the other hand, the rock on
one side appears to have been shoved up the inclined plane of
the break, the fault is termed a reverse or thrust fault.</p>

<p><i>Fault-block.</i>&mdash;A part of the earth&rsquo;s crust bounded wholly
or in part by faults.</p>

<p><i>Fault-scarp.</i>&mdash;The cliff formed by a fault. Most fault
scarps have been modified by erosion since the faulting.</p>

<p><i>Fold.</i>&mdash;A bend in rock layers or beds. Anticlines and synclines
are the common types of folds.</p>

<p><i>Formation.</i>&mdash;A rock layer, or a series of continuously deposited
layers grouped together, regarded by the geologist as
a unit for purposes of description and mapping. A formation
is usually named from some place where it is exposed in its
typical character.</p>

<p><i>Fossil.</i>&mdash;The whole or any part of an animal or plant that
has been preserved in the rocks or the impression left on rock
by a plant or animal. Preservation is invariably accompanied
by some change in substance, and from some fossils the original
substance has all been removed.</p>

<p><i>Geography.</i>&mdash;The study of the distribution of the earth&rsquo;s
physical features, in their relation to each other to the life
of sea and land, and human life and culture.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The science which deals with the history of the
earth and its inhabitants as revealed in the rocks.</p>

<p><i>Glacier.</i>&mdash;A body of ice which slowly spreads or moves over
the land from its place of accumulation.</p>

<p><i>Gneiss</i> (pronounced nice).&mdash;A metamorphic, crystalline rock
with mineral grains arranged with long axes more or less
parallel, giving the rock a banded appearance. Derived from
either igneous or stratified rocks well within the earth under
conditions of pressure, and usually also heat and moisture.</p>

<p><a id="Igneous_Rocks"></a><i>Igneous Rocks.</i>&mdash;Rocks formed by the cooling and solidification
of a hot liquid material, known as magma, that has originated
at unknown depths within the earth. Those that have
solidified beneath the surface are known as intrusive rocks,
or if the cooling has taken place slowly at great depth, as
plutonic rocks, e.g. granite. Those that have flowed out over
the surface are known as effusive rocks, extrusive rocks, or
lavas, e.g., basalt. Volcanic rocks include not only lavas,
but bombs, pumice, tuff, volcanic ash, and other fragmental
materials or ejecta thrown out from volcanoes.</p>

<p><i>Joints.</i>&mdash;Nearly all rocks, except very loose surface materials,
are separated into blocks of varying size and shape by
a system of cracks called joints. They may be caused by
earth-crust movements, contraction during solidification of
molten rocks, or contraction during drying out of sediments.</p>

poured out upon or close to the earth&rsquo;s surface, e.g. basalt.</p>

<p><i>Limestone.</i>&mdash;A sedimentary rock consisting essentially of
carbonate of lime which generally represents accumulation
of shells of organisms, but in some cases precipitates from
solution. Often impure.</p>

<p><i>Loess</i> (pronounced lurse with the r obscure).&mdash;A fine homogeneous
silt or loam showing usually no division into layers
and forming thick and extensive deposits in the Mississippi
Valley and in China. It is generally regarded as in part at
least a deposit of wind-blown dust.</p>

<p><a id="Metamorphism"></a><i>Metamorphism.</i>&mdash;Any change in rocks effected in the earth
by heat, pressure, solutions, or gases. A common cause of
the metamorphism of rocks is the intrusion into them of
igneous rocks. Rocks that have been so changed are termed
metamorphic. Marble, for example, is metamorphosed limestone.</p>

<p><i>Mineral.</i>&mdash;An inorganic substance of definite chemical composition
found ready made in nature, e.g. calcite, quartz.</p>

<p><i>Mississippian.</i>&mdash;A period of the Paleozoic era of geologic
time&mdash;in order of age, the third from the last of the era.</p>

<p><i>Moraine.</i>&mdash;Glacial drift carried on, within, or under a
glacier and deposited at the end, along the sides, or under
the glacier.</p>

<p><i>Oil-pool.</i>&mdash;An accumulation or body of oil in sedimentary
rock that yields petroleum on drilling. The oil occurs in the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">» 382 «</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rock.</i>&mdash;Any extensive constituent of the crust of the earth,
usually consisting of a mechanical mixture of two or more
minerals, e.g. granite, shale. Less commonly a rock consists
of a single mineral (e.g. pure marble), or of organic matter
(e.g. coal).</p>

<p><i>Sandstone.</i>&mdash;A sedimentary rock consisting of consolidated
or cemented sand. Often shaly or limy.</p>

<p><i>Schist.</i>&mdash;A rock that by subjection to heat and pressure
and usually moisture within the earth has undergone a change
in the character of the particles or minerals that compose it
and has these minerals arranged in such a way that the rock
splits more easily in certain directions than in others. It is
a metamorphic rock derived from either sedimentary or
igneous rock, more commonly the former.</p>

<p><i>Sedimentary Rocks.</i>&mdash;Rocks formed by the accumulation of
sediment in water (aqueous deposits) or from air (eolian
deposits). The sediment may consist of rock fragments or
particles of various sizes (conglomerate, sandstone, shale);
of the remains or products of animals or plants (certain
limestones and coal); of the product of chemical action or of
evaporation (salt, gypsum, etc.); or of mixtures of these
materials. Some sedimentary deposits (tuffs) are composed
of fragments blown from volcanoes and deposited on land or
in water. A characteristic feature of sedimentary deposits
is a layered structure known as bedding or stratification.
Each layer is a bed or stratum. Sedimentary beds as deposited
lie flat or nearly flat, but subsequently they have often
been deformed by folding and faulting.</p>

<p><i>Shale.</i>&mdash;A sedimentary rock consisting of hardened thin
layers of fine mud.</p>

<p><i>Silurian.</i>&mdash;A period of the Paleozoic era of geologic time&mdash;in
order of age, the third from the beginning of the era.</p>

<p><i>Slate.</i>&mdash;A rock that by subjection to pressure within the
earth has acquired the property of splitting smoothly into
thin plates. The cleavage is smoother and more regular than
the splitting of schist along its grain. It is a metamorphic
rock nearly always derived from shale.</p>

<p><i>Soil.</i>&mdash;The mantle of loose material resting upon bedrock,
either in its place of origin or transported by water, wind,
or ice.</p>

<p><i>Strata</i> (or stratified rocks).&mdash;Sedimentary rocks which, by
the sorting power of water (less often by wind), are arranged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">» 383 «</a></span>
in more or less definite layers or beds separated by stratification
surfaces.</p>

<p><i>Stratification.</i>&mdash;The separation of sedimentary rocks into
more or less parallel layers or beds.</p>

<p><i>Stratigraphy.</i>&mdash;The branch of geologic science that deals
with the order and relations of the strata of the earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>

<p><i>Structure.</i>&mdash;In geology, the forms assumed by sedimentary
beds and igneous rocks that have been moved from
their original position by forces within the earth, or the forms
taken by intrusive masses of igneous rock in connection with
effects produced mechanically on neighboring rocks by the
intrusion. Folds (anticlines and synclines) and faults are
the principal mechanical effects considered under structure.
Schistosity and cleavage are also structural features.</p>

<p><i>Syncline.</i>&mdash;A kind of folded structure in which strata have
been bent downward. It is an inverted arch&mdash;the opposite of
an anticline.</p>

<p><i>Talus</i> (pronounced t&#257;y&rsquo;lus).&mdash;The mass of loose rock fragments
that accumulates at the base of a cliff or steep slope.</p>

<p><i>Terrace.</i>&mdash;A steplike bench on a hillside. Most terraces
along rivers are remnants of valley bottoms formed when the
stream flowed at higher levels. Other terraces have been
formed by waves. Some terraces have been cut in solid rock,
others have been built up of sand and gravel, and still others
have been partly cut and partly built up.</p>

<p><i>Tertiary.</i>&mdash;The earlier of the two periods of the Cenozoic
era of geologic time.</p>

<p><i>Triassic.</i>&mdash;The earliest period of the Mesozoic Era of
geologic time.</p>

<p><i>Unconformity.</i>&mdash;A break in the regular succession of sedimentary
rocks, indicated by the fact that one bed rests on the
eroded surface of one or more beds which may have a distinctly
different dip from the bed above. An unconformity
may indicate that the beds below it have at some time been
raised above the sea and have been eroded. In some places
beds thousands of feet thick have been washed away before
the land again became submerged and the first bed above the
surface of unconformity was deposited. If beds of rock may
be regarded as leaves in the volume of geologic history, an
unconformity marks a gap in the record.</p>

<p><i>Vein.</i>&mdash;A mass of mineral material that has been deposited
in or along a fissure in the rocks. A vein differs from a dike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">» 384 «</a></span>
in that the vein material was introduced gradually by deposition
from solution, whereas a dike was intruded in a molten
condition. Quartz and calcite are very common vein minerals.</p>

<p><i>Volcanic Rocks.</i>&mdash;Igneous rocks erupted at or near the
earth&rsquo;s surface, including lavas, tuffs, volcanic ashes, and like
material.</p>

<p><i>Weathering.</i>&mdash;The group of processes, such as the chemical
action of air and rain water, and of plants and bacteria, and
the mechanical action of changes of temperature, whereby
rocks on exposure to the weather change in character, decay,
and finally crumble into soil.</p>
